(h1 align="center">Metaphysical Construct</h1>
<p>"Wait!  Stop!"  Sally shouted.  She was dangling off the twentieth story balcony, held by her hair in the firm grip of a nameless hand.  Traffic rushed by below at a horrendous pace, although they looked to be moving very slow from such a high altitude.  "You can't do this to me!  I'm a metaphysical construct!  Stop!"
</p>
	<p>The implacable scissors continued snipping off hair after hair.  Sally's skin stretched tight across her chin and throat.  It was beginning to get difficult to swallow, but in a few minutes that would be the least of her problems.  She struggled fruitlessly, her legs swinging and hands battering the air.
</p>
	<p>"Or, yes you can do this to me because I'm a metaphysical construct, but you really don't want to!  There's nothing you can't do to me, and therefore you don't want to do anything!  Please stop!"  She doubled the fierceness of her struggles but only succeeded in getting her entire body to sway in the breeze.  She looked downward and froze fearfully.
</p>
	<p>The scissors had almost finished their work.  Ten strands of hair remained clenched in that iron grip.  Snip, went the scissors.  Snip.
</p>
	<p>"Okay, fantasy.  You want me to explain fantasy.  I can do that.  Just give me a little time."  Snip.  "Oh - fantasy is very simple to explain.  It means that the action can take place anywhere!  Even hanging by (gulp) seven threads from a twentieth story balcony.  Stop!"
</p>
	<p>Snip.  Another red hair parted.  The sidewalk was beginning to look closer.
</p>
	<p>"Fantasy - well, you can do anything to anyone in fantasy!  The characters can be anything or anyone, and they can do anything to anyone!  Even magic!  Satire, or comedy, or even drama can be acted out in fantasy!  And you can have dragons or unicorns or Zorks from the planet Tonkyr!"  Snip snip.
</p>
	<p>"Dead people!" she gasped.  "Five hundred year old people!  Vampires!  Conan the Barbarian!"
</p>
	<p>Snip.
</p>
	<p>She struggled and watched a purple shoe fall, tumbling end over end, down until it hit the pavement.  It took a very short time to do so.
</p>
	<p>"Star-crossed lovers!"
</p>
	<p>Snip.
</p>
	<p>"Tofu hotdogs!"
</p>
	<p>Snip.
</p>
	<p>"Even-"
</p>
	<p>Snip.
</p>
	<p>"Meeeeeeeeeee."
</p>
	<p>She made a Sally shaped dent on the top of a nameless enclosed bus.  Then, almost magically, a Sally shaped hole appeared underneath her and she fell into the bus.  It closed, again almost magically, behind her, leaving her in a pitch-black space.	
</p>
	<p>"Oh dear," said Sally.  "I can't see anything.  What am I to do?"
</p>
	<p>Searching in her pockets, she found a book of matches and a bit of candle.
</p>
	<p>"Amazing," she marveled.  Of course she couldn't have put it in there before because she hadn't existed five minutes ago.  It was one of those things that seem highly improbable, if the story isn't fantasy.
</p>
	<p>She struck the match on the booklet after very carefully closing it.  Then she lit the candle before the match went out.
</p>
	<p>Looking around, she thought she was seeing a mass of zebras, but finally figured out that she was virtually surrounded by prisoners.  Big, male prisoners wearing striped clothing.  There was a bench on three of the four walls in the enclosed bus and the bench was crammed with prisoners.  They were all smiling evilly at her.
</p>
	<p>"Want some candy, little girl?" one of them cackled, sending the rest into a riot of laughter.
</p>
	<p>Their shadows danced and cavorted around the van.  The flickering candlelight made their faces into grotesque masks, although their original faces had been pretty grotesque anyway.  Sally watched them tremulously, her shaking making the candle flame waver dangerously.
</p>
	<p>"Please stop laughing," she said, sobbing a little.  "I've had a very rough day.  I've just been created, you see, and then got tossed off a building without a by-your-leave and now I'm here with a bunch of murderers and rapists.  Why couldn't I have been created in a serious fiction piece?  Then the only thing I would have had to contend with would have been a gay brother, or a straight girlfriend."
</p>
	<p>"Now you just have us," said one, winking terribly.
</p>
	<p>"Yeah, all us rapists!"
</p>
	<p>"Want to see our technique?"
</p>
	<p>"No!" yelled Sally.  "Let me out of this story!  I know when the author wants to get her book published as an adult fantasy piece that the action is liable to get pretty bloody and painful!  Otherwise it'll wind up next to the Blue Fairy Book and Edgar Allen Poe in the children's section, where all the wholesome literature is!"
</p>
	<p>"A terrible fate," agreed a prisoner.
</p>
	<p>"I'd rather not be gang-raped, thank you very much!"
</p>
	<p>"Aw, poor Sally," said another, with a hideous moue, "I think you want some cheering up."
</p>
	<p>"That would do nicely," sniffed Sally.  "No gore, please."
</p>
	<p>"Then it's your lucky day!  You see, today is Fred's birthday!"
</p>
	<p>"Happy Birthday, Fred!" shouted all the prisoners.  
</p>
<p>Fred blushed deeply.  "Aw, shucks, guys, you shouldn't have."
</p>
<p>Sally turned to see a prisoner wheeling out a white curtained cart with a round orange cake sitting on top.  She could have sworn there hadn't been one there before, but it is a fantasy story, after all.  One of the prisoners could have magicked it there, or created a hole into an alternate reality and hid it there, or something.  She decided to be polite and started clapping and cheering with the rest.
</p>
<p>The prisoner, identical to all the other prisoners, wheeled the cart in front of Sally and left it there.  Fred, who was receiving slaps on the back from the other prisoners, bent over the cake, and then looked up at Sally.  He frowned.
</p>
<p>"But there's no candles on this cake!  It's not a birthday cake without candles!"
</p>
<p>The other prisoners loudly agreed.
</p>
<p>"Sally's got a candle!" one shouted, and the rest cheered.
</p>
<p>"But I can't put my candle on the cake," Sally said reasonably, knowing without a shadow of a doubt what would happen to her if it became dark in the bus again.  "It would be dark in here, then.  How would we see to eat the cake?"
</p>
<p>The prisoners murmured.  The one spoke up.  "Why don't you light a match, then, and relight the candle after Fred blows it out?"
</p>
<p>"That seems awful bad luck," Sally said doubtfully.
</p>
<p>"Not as bad as sitting in a dark bus, though," said a prisoner.
</p>
<p>That was what they did, and after Sally had relit the candle, they cheered.  She picked it off the cake and licked the icing off the bottom of it thoughtfully.  The icing tasted of metaphysical construct, and she wrinkled her nose.
</p>
<p>"Cut the cake!  Cut the cake!" the prisoners were shouting.  She looked to the side of the cake and, sure enough, there was a long, wide, and very very sharp chef's knife lying on the white fabric.  She picked it up and admired the edge.
</p>
<p>"To be or not to be," she sighed, pensive.  "Whether 'tis nobler or something, I can never remember.  Have you ever," she said brightly, addressing the prisoners and the reader, "went to cut something and were namelessly afraid of doing so, because you weren't certain of what was inside?  I'm sure there's a technical name for the phobia.  It always happens to me when I'm cutting into pumpkins, and this cake looks very like a pumpkin."
</p>
<p>And it did, sitting there on the white fabric on the table.  The round cake looked even rounder, and she could almost see the green vines snaking from it like a Disney cartoon.  She held the blade over it, wishing she didn't have the candle in the other hand, so she could get a good support from the table.  The prisoners faded away slowly and she was left talking only to the reader.
</p>
<p>"Anything could be in a pumpkin, and pumpkin cutting traditionally being so close to Halloween I am always afraid there will be ghosts in there, or ghouls at least.  Maybe even something as prosaic as rotting pumpkin.  That's terrible enough."
</p>
<p>She steadied the knife.  It glittered in the candlelight.
</p>
<p>"But, unlike poor Hamlet, I've got to do something.  I must further the plot.  My author says so."
</p>
<p>So the knife plunged into the pumpkin/cake, and carved a big hole in the top.
</p>
<p>"See?  That wasn't so bad!" laughed Sally.
</p>
<p>The unicorn that poked its head out of the hole agreed with her.  "It's never as bad as you think," it said, and blew the candle out.  
</p>
<p>"Does this cake taste of metaphysical construct, or is it just me?"
</p>


<p><br>	"You see," Sally told the unicorn, doggy paddling.  "We are without limits."
</p>
	<p>The unicorn opened one limpid brown eye.  "Do tell," it sighed, closing it again languorously.  
</p>
	<p>"We can be bigger than the world, or smaller than the littlest speck of dust," Sally enthused.
</p>
	<p>The unicorn settled itself a little better on the inflatable blue pool lounger and trailed a hoof in the water.  "That's comforting to know."
</p>
	<p>"I can also do magic," Sally said.  "Would you like me to turn that cloud over there chartreuse?"
</p>
	<p>"What's chartreuse?" asked the unicorn.
</p>
	<p>"Kind of a yellow-green."
</p>
	<p>"Sure," said the unicorn, adjusting its aluminum foil reflectors.
</p>
	<p>Sally muttered an incantation and flicked her fingers about in an eldritch way.  After a couple of false starts, the cloud blushed an amazingly bright chartreuse, and, affronted, slunk away muttering to itself.  The unicorn lifted its head from the orange foam roll and took note of the change with interest.  
</p>
	<p>"Cool," Sally said, amazed.
</p>
	<p>"Cool," the unicorn agreed.  "Can you turn that cloud over there into a manticore?  I would love a little manticore for lunch."
</p>
	<p>"Sure!  There are no limits!"
</p>

<p>	"Of course there are limits!" something shouted.
</p>
	<p>Sally and the unicorn looked around until they saw a little green frog on the side of the pool, by the drain.  Paddling over, Sally picked it up.  It sat on her palm, glaring and shaking angrily.
</p>
	<p>"This is fantasy," Sally told the frog deprecatingly.  "There are no limits."
</p>
	<p>"What are you, blind?" yelled the frog. "Look around you!  Look all around you!  It's everywhere, surrounding us!"
</p>
	<p>Sally and the unicorn looked around obediently, but all they saw was the pool, the beautiful blue sky, the palm trees and the huge water slides, one red and one yellow, that hadn't been there a moment ago.  A tourist waved.  The chartreuse cloud was almost over the horizon.
</p>
	<p>The frog became more and more angry.  "It's everywhere!  Are you stupid?" it kept saying.
</p>
	<p>"I guess I am," Sally said eventually.  "What are the limits you are talking about?"
</p>
	<p>"Look around!  We're on a page!  And we're just ink!  We can't be anything but ink!  Limit, indeed," harrumphed the frog.  "We can't even get off this page.  We aren't real!"
</p>
	<p>"Of course we're not real, silly," said Sally.  "That's why we don't have limits.  Fantasy stories know this.  They know they're not real, and it frees them.  While serious fiction pieces take themselves so seriously they make their own limits, fantasy stories continually break free of them.  Real things don't have a choice.  Their limits are unbreakable.
</p>
	<p>"Sorry," she said to the reader.
</p>
	<p>The unicorn splashed its hooves in the water.  "I want to go on the water slide," it said.  "The red one."
</p>
	<p>"Let's do that while the author gets some sleep," said Sally.  "Poor thing."
</p>
	<p>The frog rolled its eyes and swam away.</p>
