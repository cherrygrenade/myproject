A long time ago, everything was fire. All of space was filled with this
fire, in every direction. Nothing existed; not suns, not planets, not
molecules. This vast fire filled the universe. Pockets of fire exploded
within the conflagration of the whole, causing waves of fire to rebound
and clash against other waves of fire. This boundless energy caused even
the universe to buckle and expand, and the fire grew larger and larger,
and larger and larger still.

A human on the surface of the Earth now can tilt a metal tube filled
with glass up to the sky and take a picture within a certain spectrum of
light and see the moment of time when the universe became so large and
the energy within the fire so diffuse that it burnt out, much like a
match will gutter and flare until it dies. And, much like a match, the
resulting smoke from the fire drifted in the dark, unmeasurable empty
space left behind from the mighty force of the fire, which had pushed
the universe open.

The smoke spun in the space, curling in the eddies left by the
rebounding fire. There was so much of it, and it was so heavy, that it
began to fall into itself. Infinitesimally tiny bits of the smoke caught
alight once again, sparks that illuminated the smoke with their sunrays.
Other bits were so dense that they created small holes in the universe,
barely perceptible pinpricks in the fabric where energy was caught and
drained away.

The spinning smoke separated into revolving pools - raggedy mixtures of
smoke and sparks of fire and tiny holes. Countless numbers of these
pools contracted and became separate from each other as the smoke
continued to clump together. Inside these pools of smoke, barely
detectable from any sort of distance, tiny eddies spun and also began to
clump up, and more sparks of light shone into the darkness. Around these
sparks, so incredibly small that the human with the metal tube cannot
see them, minute motes of smoke stuck together and continued their
spinning paths around their spark.

On one of these motes complex chemicals reacted and became
self-replicating. These chemicals, in various forms, covered the mote
and became many things, including humans with metal tubes who stared at
the universe and marvelled at the place where they found themselves.

Humans believe, as they sit on their mote of dust, that they can control
the universe. Humans thought that it would help to know more about the
smoke, and the sparks, and the holes. They developed bigger tubes, and
better glass, even going so far as to litter the empty space around
their mote with these things.

In order to make things comfortable for their sense of control, humans
associated particular patterns of energy with each mote of dust, each
spark, and each hole. These names make humans feel that they have a
handle on things, as if the pattern of energy is at all related to the
clump of matter.

The humans named the cold mote of dust that spins furthest from their
tiny spark Neptune. Then, these incomparably miniscule self-replicating
collections of molecules expended a great deal of their limited energy
to produce two tubes of metal and push them further from their spark
than they ever had before, far past Neptune, a great achievement that
they celebrated. These two tubes orbited their spark on either side,
keeping the same distance between them at all times.

These two metal tubes the humans named the All Sky Network. From here
the humans could more easily resolve motes of dust around other sparks.
They were amazed at their own cleverness.

They looked through the All Sky Network and began associating patterns
of energy with a number of other motes that orbited other sparks. They
began recognising the attributes of each mote, and what chemicals these
motes consisted of. When they recognised self-replicating chemicals,
they became excited, for their true goal was to find a mote exactly like
their own, so that the humans may self-replicate around other sparks.

They found just such a mote around a blue-green spark that they called
Alnair B. The humans had always considered this star to be promising and
the right type of star for life, as it was much the same as Sol, their
name for their own spark. After it was discovered by the humans, the
mote was investigated as thoroughly as it could be by Earth-centric
telescopes, and then the humans turned the eyes of the All Sky Network
towards Alnair B.

The results had delighted the human research team, and the lead human
researcher labelled the mote with the same pattern of energy his beloved
progenitor was also assigned: Angharad. And thus the humans believed
they had control of this bit of matter that danced around its spark
through space.

Near Orbit, Angharad, Year 214

She had to go to medbay soon. The thought ticked away at the back of her
mind as she rotated, weightless, in the centre of the sensory chamber.
Around her in almost every direction were stars, flowing in an endless
river against the absolute black of space. Behind her, and coming into
view now as she turned as slowly as if she was a planet herself, was the
face of Angharad.

The beautiful bright blue arc of its atmosphere cut against the black of
space with a cleanness that felt like music, like poetry. Her hair fell
against her face as she strained to see more of Angharad; the bright
green of plant matter, the deep blue of water, the subtle brown and grey
notes of mountains, the white whorls of clouds. She had never seen the
Earth like this, but she had been told that Angharad was its more gentle
twin, separated by an unfathomable distance.

Eventually the blue and green pool of life lay below and in front of
her. Uncurling, she stretched out her arms as far as she could, arching
her back, trying to fall towards the planet. Her left arm resisted this
but she ignored it. *Swan dive*, she thought. Angharad twinkled in front
of her remotely, teasing, uncaring.

This was a live feed from cameras and sensors on the exterior of the
ship, projected into her eyes and into the room from the walls of the
chamber. Right now, those clouds were swirling, catching the light of
the bluish white star called Alnair B. Almost too bright to look at,
even through the cameras. Their gentle motion briefly made her dizzy.

"Medbay," her book chimed.

Her lips tightened. "Fine," she said. "Quit programme."

The blackness of space faded away to reveal the clean white of the
sensory chamber and the thick cushioned floor. The false gravity
asserted itself gently, so she was able to orient herself and get her
feet underneath her before they touched the ground. Her left foot almost
folded, but she remembered her weakness in time and stood, albeit
unsteadily.

It took her a couple of minutes to struggle over the yielding floor to
the chamber door. "Medbay," her book chimed, louder. "I am going," she
said, irritated. Mostly because the dream of Angharad was a little
farther away, but also because she hated medbay. She slapped at the
door, which whooshed as it opened for her. Her book detached from the
bookplate on the wall and followed her silently out the door and into
the blue landing, above and slightly behind her left shoulder.

Medbay was two levels down and on another blue landing, placing it as
far from the engines as she could travel within the passenger zone. She
dropped down the low gravity chute and grabbed the handrail to that
floor, smoothly pivoting to place her feet neatly on the thin, tightly
woven carpet. The transition between weightlessness and gravity could be
jarring the first few times. She had enough practice now to feel
confident with it.

*I wonder if it will come in handy to know how to do this, if I'm stuck
up here* -- and she cut the thought short, frowning, and limped down the
corridor.

The medbay door was open, and she invited herself in. "Hi Steff," she
said to the young man inside, who had his back to her. He was the sole
medical support on board the ship, and the person she saw the most
often.

"Hi Jean," he said, glancing briefly at her, his hazel eyes distracted.
"Go ahead and sit on the table, I'll be right with you."

She obediently sat on the table, the hard edges biting into her legs,
and surveyed the room. It was chock full of gleaming boxes and storage
bays, some big enough to fit a person, some small with blank readouts
that could be used for---anything, she supposed. At the far end of the
room was a metal double door with a red cross that ran along its width,
closed and rather imposing. The bookplate held a few generic books that
she didn't know the reason for -- maybe they were meant to provide some
kind of convalescent-focused learning and exercises? She would ask her
book later. It had just finished an exploration of the room, settling
next to the generic books on the bookplate.

"Right," said Steff, finishing stocking one of the storage bays and
turning to her. "Let's see how you are doing today. Lay back, please."

She laid down on the table and he reached up to pull the treatment dome
down over her. It clicked as it touched the table, sealing it airtight.
Her ears rang. A small speaker in front of her face transmitted Steff's
words to her. "Try to remain still."

Jean breathed out in a sigh, and uncomfortably remained as stiff as she
could. She tried to distract herself by wondering what exactly the
scanner was doing to her. Was it manipulating her electrical fields? Was
it testing the components of her breath? Was it making judgments on the
oiliness of her skin? It hummed and flashed a few times, and, as usual,
she wondered whether the exposure to radiation would cause her problems
later.

Eventually her ears popped again as the seal was broken. Steff pushed
the dome up, settling it in the brackets on the ceiling, and then turned
away.

Jean sat up, hooked her legs over the edges of the table again, and
waited while Steff went through the readout. Her right hand spread
itself over the top of the table, supporting her weight, but her left
hand curled into her lap like a wounded animal. She frowned at it and
forced it open. It tingled.

Still staring at it, she asked flatly, "So will there be a treatment
today?"

"Umm," said Steff. "It's a difficult one." His hands gracefully flipped
through the readouts, folding one and pushing one away. They were all
virtual, of course, so they disappeared as soon as they left the readout
plate of the machine. He tapped a few times and more paper appeared.
"You've just had a treatment three days ago and it has only marginally
improved your condition."

She had known that, but it still made her stomach drop nastily inside
her. "But another one might help?" she asked. She closed her hand into a
fist.

"Might, possibly, but more likely it will only have another marginal
response. It takes time for nerves to respond and grow, especially when
some of the tissue isn't responding either. You're lucky," he said, as
he said every time, "that you haven't lost a limb or fingers entirely.
Most people with hibernation burn lose a lot more than you have."

"But I've lost everything," she said, as she said every time.

He nodded awkwardly at her. There was a long pause.

"Well if it's a marginal response, it is still a response," she said,
begrudgingly. "I'd rather have something than nothing, I suppose. Could
I have the treatment?"

"If you are sure," he said. And then went to the other side of the room,
turning his back discreetly.

She was starting to get angry again, but recognised it and took a
deliberate breath. She stood and shucked off her clothing, making her
left hand do its fair share of the work, and letting the bench support
her when her left leg couldn't do it. She also grimly forced herself to
neatly fold her clothing and put it on a nearby chair, even though the
stretchy fabric of her shipsuit didn't need it and wouldn't crease no
matter what was done to it.

Hibernation burn was rare. They were supposed to have fixed the problem
by using new methods in storage and revival. She was certain that the
induction material said so. Each new settler was screened for this. The
attitude of the medical team had been reassuringly business-like and
matter-of-fact in her induction. She remembered drinking a cloudy liquid
and having tests taken as to her metabolic response. It had been normal.
She hadn't been worried about it. She hadn't even thought that she
should be worried about it.

And she had woken up, frightened, with a dead arm and leg and two people
(Steff had been one of them) trying to reassure her through the walls of
the medbay treatment dome.

She lay back down again, under the dome, which Steff, politely averting
his eyes, once again pulled down to click against the table. This time,
the whorled glass turned red.

Taking a deep breath, she closed her eyes and gritted her teeth. Her
hands clenched.

The treatment was for a full half hour. It was boring, and it hurt. She
spent the whole time cataloguing how much she hated each part of the
treatment and ranking them in order of awfulness. She hated the sonic
waves, which made her arm tense up, vibrate and jitter against the metal
table, and her leg flex and cramp. Then of course there was the heat
treatment, which cut through her skin and set her bones on fire. She
gasped, and turned her face to the side, but she couldn't escape that
pain. Then she had to breathe in fumes which irritated her sinuses and
made her eyes, closed as they were, weep into her hair. There was a
series of injections at some point into her heel and her wrist, which
caused the heat to turn into ice. And something else that put a metallic
taste into her mouth and twisted her stomach. The glass box flashed
around her, causing her vision to spark.

*Marginal*, she thought. *Only marginal. How many treatments have I
had... I've been out of hibernation for twelve weeks. Three times a
week, and there were more at the beginning. And my fingers still can't
reach across an octave*... she swallowed. She was not going to cry here.
Steff didn't need that.

*What am I going to do*, she thought, a slight edge of hysteria adding
to a feeling of claustrophobia. She wished she could raise her arms so
she could use her hands to wipe the tears from her eyes. *What am I
going to do?*

The cold air hit her like a slap when it was over. She lay trembling for
a moment, breathing the sterile air of the medbay in harsh gasps. When
she finally sat up, Steff wrapped a blanket around her shoulders.
Leaning against the table, he put an arm around her and rubbed her back.

"I think we should give it a week, next time," he said.

"Maybe," she said, voice low and shaky. She didn't meet his eyes.

He gave her back a final pat, tucked the blanket around her, and went to
rummage in a bin. "There's one more thing we can try, Jean," he said. "I
haven't suggested it because it's a bit uncomfortable and you've been
through a lot, and also there's conflicting evidence as to whether it
works."

"Alright," she agreed.

"You don't know what it is yet," he said over his shoulder. "Ah, here it
is."

It turned out to be two lengths of white tubing. Steff put one on the
table beside her, and held the other out like a sock. "For your leg," he
said. "It's a pressure cuff with stimulants. It goes under your clothes,
which hold it in place."

She took it. "Stimulants?" she asked, dubiously.

"Various," he said, giving her a little, humourless, smile. "There is a
small dose externally but there are also hundreds of hair-fine needles
that deliver an internal dose. The needles themselves provide a
mechanical stimulus, and encourage the release of hormones that may
help. The cuff, along with a steady pressure, massages gently externally
and keeps the area quite warm. It should be left on for at least five
days without removal."

"And that is for my arm?" she said, indicating the other cuff with a
wave of the hand holding the first cuff. Her left hand lay closed in her
lap. It ached, slightly.

Steff nodded. "As I said, it is uncomfortable. You won't be able to
clean under the cuff, and it restricts movement. You won't be able to
use your hand because it goes over your fingers too. I wouldn't usually
recommend these because the normal treatments are enough. But you seem
to be resistant to the normal treatments, so I would suggest using these
along with a higher dose of your medication. Three times a day instead
of once."

She thought about this. "And you say it may not work?"

He nodded, once. "It may not work. But other than continuing normal
treatments, it's all I can offer."

The tube hung limply from her hand. It felt like cloth around the edges.
She rubbed it between her fingers gently, and then looked briefly at the
quiescent glass dome above her. And then thought about music, and the
bright marble of Angharad.

"Alright," she said again.

If all looked promising, tiny drones were launched from the central gate
known as TTG. Jean knew about the TTG. It was where interstellar traffic
launched. It was the Tripartite Trebuchet Gate: tripartite because it
was built in cooperation between three nations; trebuchet because it
used the slingshot drive to operate; and gate because it was the means
to get between two places. She had been there, during her hibernation.

Thousands of these drones launched to these planets. A few were sent to
Angharad by NiñaPinta. They orbited their chosen planets for months,
sometimes years, taking pictures and analysing the atmosphere. The ones
around Angharad had noted the brilliant signatures of life, the tame
climate, the vast oceans and lakes.

The drones returned to Earth with their news, launching back through a
small unmanned slingshot gate that they had towed to Alnair B,
resurfacing in normal space some light-minutes away from Earth (Jean
didn't understand all of the details, but she did know that the shock
wave from entry into a solar system could cause damage to existing
gravitational structures - each slingshot journey had to be carefully
controlled in angle of re-entry for fear of disturbing asteroid belts or
knocking planets off their orbits). They beamed their data to Earth and
returned to the station attached to the TTG for maintenance and
refitting for the next mission. It took months to return to the gate
from re-entry - that was the longest part of the journey when using the
slingshot drive.

The data from the Angharad probes had been very promising, and NiñaPinta
moved to the next step - landing drones. These were sent along with
another traditional drone which would take the data from the landing
drones and convey it back to Earth; the landing drones would only have a
one way trip. The landing drones took soil, air and temperature samples
from Angharad, and a few flying ones measured wind strength and patterns
and made close inspections of the geography.

As all of this was promising (Angharad was full of promise), a human
survey team was then sent to visit the planet. These were highly
trained, specialised scientists who spent their lives shooting around
the galaxy. They were expensive, and only visited planets where
settlement was highly likely. They spent a month on Angharad, digging
through the soil, making assessments on geological formations and
mining, and determining the best place for settlement. They had noted
with particular emphasis the growth rate and verdancy of the native
plant species in almost breathless excitement for a survey report.
Angharad had been rated the highest of all known exoplanets on the
habitable scale.

On the strength of the survey assessment, NiñaPinta commissioned a ship
and began preparations for settlement. Potential settlers were sought
and, with their life savings, NiñaPinta outfitted the journey and took a
tidy profit for themselves. Jean herself had emptied her bank account,
sold her flat, her velotrike, and her interest in her father's old
company, and handed it all over to the smiling representative at
NiñaPinta. She wouldn't need money where she was going, after all.

The chartered ship left through the TTG. The journey took only a few
weeks - once the fabric of spacetime had been stretched in one direction
often enough, there was a "memory" of that journey that was left behind,
making the journey less energy intensive and quicker each time the same
path through space was made. The drones and the survey ship had
accomplished this for the Hello and How Are You?, and so the ship
skipped across space with no resistance.

It still took some months for the ship to move from its outer position
to the inner orbit around rocky Angharad, and during that time the crew
took stock of inventory, took measurements of Alnair B and its
surroundings, and oriented themselves in the galaxy. Once the ship
achieved stable orbit, the crew began reviving the initial settlement
party and stocking the landers.

At first, when the initial team landed, they were pleased. The soil was
as rich as advertised, the water as clear and pure, and the sunlight as
perfect as it could be for the growing of crops.

The medbay door closed behind her, she stood on the thin carpet on the
blue landing, looking at the low gravity chute. She had a new cane in
her hand, lightweight but sturdy and with a hook at the end, to "aid
balance" as Steff said. Her shipsuit was elastic enough that it had
stretched to fit the cuffs, but it pulled when she walked. The pressure
cuffs were stiffening on her limbs and would for several hours. They
already felt uncomfortably warm, and even though Steff had assured her
she wouldn't feel the needles, she felt a prickle against her skin. She
hoped it wouldn't drive her mad, later.

She tapped the cane on the floor several times. And then, making a quick
decision, continued down the hall in the direction of the engines, book
following silently behind. *Aft,* she thought.

She had been told that she would only be able to access those parts of
the ship with blue walls, as these were passenger areas. When she was
first revived, she hadn't been very interested in exploring. She had
been stuck in a chair for a while, which would have prohibited her from
exploring much in any case. And... she hadn't felt well.

The blue walls extended to the mess area. There were two people here,
both reading quietly to themselves from their books, which projected
information on the table before them, or on special glasses or lenses.
There were four long tables with benches to either side, and a small
galley along one wall where she usually took her breakfast.

She paused in front of the galley. A pot of coffee steamed gently,
looking thoroughly black and bitter, and a small tray held snack cubes
and fruit squares. Paper envelopes were lined beside the tray,
containing a mixture of grains, dried fruit, seeds and nutrients that
could be rehydrated with hot reconstituted milk to make a thick
porridge. It was what she usually had for breakfast. It made her stomach
turn slightly, now.

She looked around. She didn't recognise the two people, and she couldn't
tell from their clothing what role they had on the ship. She had only
met Steff and Lynn, the liaison for the passengers on the *Hello and How
Are You?*. These two seemed oblivious to her.

At the end of the galley was a white door, trimmed with gold and with a
gold slash diagonally across it. Jean gripped her cane and started for
it.

She was through it before she had time to wonder if it was a good idea.
There was a white hallway with a thick gold stripe extending to either
side. She chose the left hall and determinedly, slowly, set off in that
direction.

It took more time than she thought for the door from the mess to open
behind her, and a voice to half-shout, "Excuse me! Hey, miss, excuse
me!" She only proceeded a few more steps before someone slipped around
her to cut her off.

She stopped perforce, and leant unsteadily on her cane. It was difficult
to draw herself up, but she did her best, and coolly asked, "May I help
you?"

"Passengers aren't allowed in this area, miss. Only the blue corridors,"
said the man, a small frown on his face but his voice trying to be
friendly, "not these white ones." She thought she saw a bit of amusement
as well, which raised her hackles.

She modulated her tone, however, and said as sweetly as she could,
"After twelve weeks, I believe it could be said that I am part of the
crew. And now I would like to speak with the captain. I hope he has time
for me in his busy schedule of endlessly orbiting the same planet.
Perhaps you could guide me to him?"

"I could take a message to him, but you are certainly able to message
him yourself. Or you could always speak with Lynn. Unfortunately you
will need to remain in the passenger part of the ship for your own
safety. This way, please," he said, and made a grab for her arm.

She twisted away, pivoting on her cane and now-stiff leg. "The captain
does not answer messages, and Lynn won't tell me anything," she snapped.
"And you will not touch me. Do you understand?" She glared at him,
gripping the cane, fully prepared to strike him with it if he tried to
grab her again.

The man made a shocked face, and held his hands out in front of him,
open palms showing. "Okay miss, okay." After a moment of thought, he
added, "I will get the captain. Okay? But you need to return to the mess
hall at least. I'll go get him, if you go to the mess hall. Would that
be alright?"

Jean stood for a moment, mouth in a thin line, and tapped her cane once,
twice, three times. The man waited with hands still up, although relaxed
slightly, and still with that hint of a smile. She wasn't sure what
would happen if she simply walked around him. With her luck, she would
probably be confined to her tiny quarters.

She snorted, then shook her head. "Fine," she snapped. "I'll wait. But
if he doesn't show up I will go find him, and you won't stop me then. I
want answers."

"Okay, okay," the man said, and ushered her back to the mess area.

It took about fifteen minutes, which gave a little time for her anger to
cool again. The pressure cuffs were becoming stiffer and warmer by the
minute, and also distressingly itchy. She practised some breathing
exercises. A few minutes into these, carefully looking casually into the
opposite direction, the other crew member in the mess hall left through
the gold-barred door. Jean glared after her.

And then, perversely, felt like crying, but she wouldn't cry. Not here.

After some time, the door opened again and a man in the normal light
grey crew shipsuit came through. His had a bit of black piping along the
shoulders, which she suspected signified some rank. He was neither tall
nor short, but he did have some white in his hair, and tired eyes that
lifted from the floor to settle, with reluctance, on her. He didn't look
much like the promotional materials.

"I believe you are Jean Harrell," he said. "I have been meaning to speak
with you in any case, so this is as fine a time as any. I am Captain
Segard. Alan Segard, but call me Segard. I haven't had anyone call me
Alan in so long I've forgotten what it's like. I probably wouldn't even
answer to it. Would you like some coffee?" He picked up the pot and
swirled it, smelled it, made a face, and put it back.

"Okay," she said, although she still didn't feel like it.

"Good," he said, snapping the rocker switch on the machine. It hummed
and gurgled. His book, she noticed, was cycling through colours, and she
guessed that he was looking at a readout on the otherwise clear lenses
he was wearing. "I've had a long few hours on this shift already and I
could use an excuse for a break. The latest reports from Angharad Two
don't match the previous ones and we're trying to figure out why. You
wouldn't, by any chance, have any idea why they would underreport yields
for corn this year -- or overreport for last year? And issue what looks
like entirely fictionalised rainfall records for the last five months?
We have cameras, we can see what the clouds are doing. I've no idea what
they are thinking."

He put a thick plastic mug in front of her on the white table top, and
swung out a chair to sit on it sideways. His book hovered a few inches
in front of the table, still busily changing colours. "But that's hardly
what you would like to talk about, I'm sure. What can I do for you, Miss
Harrell?"

Her mouth opened, closed, opened again. "I'd like to know why I am still
on this ship," she said.

He nodded. "A reasonable question. And happily there is an easy answer.
We wouldn't want to send an injured colonist to any of the colonies
without doing all we can for her here, and the colonies are refusing to
accept new colonists at the moment, for the most part."

"But aren't there better medical facilities on Angharad?" she asked.
"There is only a medbay here, not a hospital. There should be excellent
medical facilities on the surface. Surely I would do better there.
And... where are all of the other settlers? I thought there would be
thirty people here on the ship, waiting to go down, at any one time."

"Ah," he said. He drank some of his coffee. She waited, tense.

He tapped his lenses twice and then traced a rectangle on the surface of
the table. To her surprise, a hologram of Angharad appeared, which he
pulled and moved until one of the continents, the one that looked like a
tilted anvil, lay stretched out upon the table. He tapped his lenses
again, and then removed them and rubbed his eyes.

"A live image," he said. "Right up here," and he moved his finger to one
pointed end at the top of the anvil, "is Angharad One. You were to go to
Angharad One."

"I know," Jean interrupted, still caught by the magic of that jewelled
surface. "I was to help set up the schools there. And work in the fields
when necessary, repairing machinery." She frowned, then stared at him.
"I prepared for that for months. Almost a year, class after class on
working with equipment, learning how to service and operate it. I also
did a whole module on teaching lower level mathematics because I, well,
I usually teach m-music. Being disabled can't hurt my ability to teach
-- much -- " her voice threatened to break, but she took a breath to
steady it, "just repair things. And maybe not even that, I still have
the use of my hands even if they aren't perfect..." She took another
breath, and her fists clenched again. The fingers of her left hand were
hindered by the cuff, which cost her another stab of pain from grief in
her throat.

"And... and," her voice started to creep in volume, and she ruthlessly
quelled it, "it hasn't escaped my knowledge that I was only supposed to
be in hibernation for three years and it has been *ten*. And no one has
explained this!"

The captain was listening alertly, but at this point shook his head.
"Your induction training did include information about the length of
hibernation," he said. "You were informed that the length of hibernation
could vary up to fifty years and that we would make our best endeavours
to remove you from hibernation as soon as it was optimal in order for
you to begin your life on Angharad."

"They said three. Maybe two, if everything went well," she persisted.
"And don't you think the length of my hibernation may have contributed
to this problem I'm having?" She waved her arm to show the stiffness of
the cuff.

His eyebrows rose, and he put his lenses back on. His hand, extended
over the map, started sketching things in the air, and his book twirled
in place. After a pause, he said, "Your medical records indicate that
the lack of response was due to variances within your own chemical
makeup at the time of hibernation, possibly some sort of stress
reaction. Even if you had been in hibernation for the full fifty years
you would have been no worse off." He gestured again, and the book
spread out more readouts, this time in front of her. "Have a look, if
you wish."

The pages were marked CONFIDENTIAL in red, and flickered when she looked
at them.

"One moment, I have to change the permissions," said the captain, and
made more gestures. "The policy is that you are not supposed to be able
to have access to these, but they are your records and I can override
that. Hopefully it will make you feel a little better to know more."

She took a moment to leaf through the pages in front of her. She had to
stop because the pages meant nothing -- she was too upset to read them.
She waved to her book, which hovered to make a copy for her to read
later.

"So am I, am I never to go down," she asked, swallowing.

The captain raised his eyebrows again. "Of course you will go down. We
hardly have the space or resources to keep you indefinitely up here. And
the colonies do need people, however much they complain about any
influx." He shook his head. "Put a man in a country and he immediately
complains about immigration... anyway, Jean. I was hoping that you could
help with a small query that has come up."

She stared. "Query?"

He nodded, and made some adjustments in the map, bringing Angharad One
into miniature sharp relief. Jean, expecting a small but busy
settlement, was confused at first, but then leaned forward in surprise.
"Is that... is that all of it? Just those buildings?" she asked the
captain, who only smiled slightly. His eyes looked very tired, she
noticed again. She shook her head in disbelief. "That can't be right.
It's been ten years! There must only be twenty buildings there. And so
few fields! This looks like six months of work!"

Captain Segard picked up his cup of coffee and relaxed back in his
chair, whether from fatigue or a desire to put her at ease, she couldn't
tell. He smiled again, but cynically. "Yes. As you have already noted,
we have been having some trouble getting the colony going. Timelines
have slipped considerably. Projections, let's see the projection overlay
for ten years."

The book superimposed over the live image the projected colony that Jean
had reviewed as part of her training. It flickered slightly. The captain
leant forward and traced his finger through the image. "What we have is
the central building block composed of labs, offices, and housing. Then
we have the granary, the feed lots -- we've managed to bring in chicken
farming, although they aren't doing well, the poor things -- the
machinery housing and repair, and other bits and pieces that are
necessary. Here," he drew his finger across, "is where we are trying to
start the fields.

"This is the main limiting factor. There are barely two hundred people
in this settlement, and this is the best performing settlement on
Angharad. They can feed themselves, but only just, and I understand
there is much anger over the lack of food variety. We can't grow the
colony without a fresh supply of food."

Segard moved the image back to the settlement. "Labs, offices, housing,
food, fields. No hospitals. The medical facilities we do have are as
primitive as the medbay, and likely not getting any better in the
immediate or even near future."

With a flick, he again panned outward. "Angharad Two," he said, focusing
on another part of the anvil, "is at least not complaining about food
variety. They are more worried about... well, that is what I wanted to
speak to you about." He paused. "Would you like more coffee? I have been
living on the stuff lately." At her head shake, he went back to the pot
with his single mug.

She stared at the map. She could see the vegetation ripple in the
breeze, and a few glinting machines, about the size of a grain of rice,
scuttle across the growth. She could count only a few buildings, all of
them small. This was about a month into the original plan. The fields
were ill-defined brown spots, and she couldn't see if there was anything
growing on them.

This... this was a catastrophe. There must be thousands of colonists
still waiting in cryo, still hoping that they would be able to set foot
on a brand new planet. She was supposed to be one of the middle
colonists, the ones who would provide niceties like schools and leisure
facilities and entertainment. She felt a sick sinking feeling in her
chest. It wasn't supposed to be like this. Her dream was... it was
impossible.

The captain sat back down and put his mug in front of him, overlapping
the edge of the map. "For anything more, we're going to have to have
privacy," he said, and clicked his fingers. Her ears felt deadened as
his book created a break in the sounds around them. It was always a very
close and uncomfortable feeling -- you never knew how much you relied on
the sounds bouncing back from the walls to inform you of where you were
until it was abruptly cut off.

He sighed, and rubbed his forehead. He looked at her directly, out of
his tired eyes. "You must agree to complete confidentiality of
everything we will discuss next," he said formally.

"Um. I agree." Her voice was husky.

"Splendid. And your name, please."

"Jean Harrell."

"Excellent. Jean Harrell, we woke you earlier than we would have done,
my apologies, but we do have a small problem we would like your help
with. This is separate from the other problem that is slowing our
development at Angharad Two. And when I say Angharad Two, I mean that
this problem causing slow development exists in most of the western
portion of this continent. See... from here to here... there is a lovely
flattish plain, beautiful dark loam, wonderful nitrogen rich soil.
Perfect for growing crops. We've placed our colony in an auspicious
part, and we don't wish to move it.

"The biology team that helped with the survey of the planet didn't try
to grow anything there, unfortunately. If they had, they would have
found that the local flora is very, shall we say, competitive."

She was shaking her head. "I don't know anything about plants, other
than what I learned about domesticated crops during my machine course.
Why me?"

He shrugged. "You don't know anything about plants, but you do know
about music. This is the separate problem that we need help with."

Jean's leg was becoming uncomfortably hot, and she shifted in her seat
irritably. "Music," she said flatly. "That doesn't make sense. What am I
supposed to do, sing to the plants? I'm not a good singer, sorry. And I
can't play, not anymore. Not with -- this -- " and she shook her cuffed
arm at him. The idea of not playing anymore had kept her awake at nights
in panicked grief, but now she just felt annoyed. Life was not being
predictable and it all felt absurd to be here in the bubble next to the
coffee machine.

Segard grimaced. "I'll try to explain. I'm aware it sounds strange and I
don't blame you for questioning it."

He enlightened her, with short gestures, making the map expand and
contract, his book whirling and sparkling. She listened closely, if
sceptically. She wouldn't have believed that the captain of the huge
ship in the belly of which they sat, a captain who should have more
important things to do, would be patiently explaining to her things that
he had no doubt spent many an hour discussing and worrying at with more
informed people. She thought there must be something more to it.

Alnair B was an energetic star that was strong in the exact wavelengths
that encouraged plants to grow, the blue part of the spectrum (where Sol
was strongest in the border between blue and green). There were no
animals to speak of on Angharad, not anything that humans would consider
to be animals anyway. Life had chosen to manifest itself mainly as plant
life, with thick cell walls and a reliance on chlorophyll for energy.
Jean had known this. It was in all of the recruitment materials.

Angharad was billed as a lush world, perfect for crops, bucolic and
genteel. There had been glossy brochures of green valleys, tall
waterfalls, and clear waters lapping at beaches available for public
perusal. She had poured over these at night after work, pausing marking
her students' essays to ask her book to give her yet another sensory
tour of the planet. Tall ferns and grasses, and some even taller
treelike plants, arched over her, with an earthy smell and soft rustling
of the leaves surrounding her, transporting her. It was hypnotic. In her
small dark flat, sitting at a thin, cheap table in her exceptionally
tiny kitchen/living room, the dirt and noise of the city pounding on the
other side of her rattling window panes, it had seemed like an escape.
She'd really had no choice.

She had felt so lucky to be accepted, jubilant and terrified in turns.
The *Hello and How Are You?* was chartered by a joint venture company
called NiñaPinta. It had been all over the news aggregators that they
were taking applications for colonists. NiñaPinta stated that it wanted
applications from every walk of life, from every type of person - very
different from previous settlement voyages where applicants had been
limited to scientists and mining specialists. She had hurriedly put her
application in, which had included an essay about why she wanted to
leave her life on Earth. NiñaPinta hadn't wanted anyone to regret their
decision. Writing that essay had been the easiest part of the process,
for Jean.

She had only dimly understood what had already happened on Angharad by
the time she had written her application, but Seagard informed her in a
few words. First, the star had been catalogued as the right type of star
for life, and then work had been done to find out from that catalogue
whether there were any planets that were in the habitable zone. If there
was strong evidence, the planet was mapped as well as it could be by
Earth-centric telescopes, and then by the enormous All Sky network that
lay past the orbit of Neptune. If all looked promising, tiny drones were
launched from the central gate known as TTG. Jean knew about the TTG. It
was where interstellar traffic launched. It was the Tripartite Trebuchet
Gate: tripartite because it was built in cooperation between three
nations; trebuchet because it used the slingshot drive to operate; and
gate because it was the means to get between two places. She had been
there, during her hibernation.

Thousands of these drones launched to these planets. A few were sent to
Angharad by NiñaPinta. They orbited their chosen planets for months,
sometimes years, taking pictures and analysing the atmosphere. The ones
around Angharad had noted the brilliant signatures of life, the tame
climate, the vast oceans and lakes.

The drones returned to Earth with their news, launching back through a
small unmanned slingshot gate that they had towed to Alnair B,
resurfacing in normal space some light-minutes away from Earth (Jean
didn't understand all of the details, but she did know that the shock
wave from entry into a solar system could cause damage to existing
gravitational structures - each slingshot journey had to be carefully
controlled in angle of re-entry for fear of disturbing asteroid belts or
knocking planets off their orbits). They beamed their data to Earth and
returned to the station attached to the TTG for maintenance and
refitting for the next mission. It took months to return to the gate
from re-entry - that was the longest part of the journey when using the
slingshot drive.

The data from the Angharad probes had been very promising, and NiñaPinta
moved to the next step - landing drones. These were sent along with
another traditional drone which would take the data from the landing
drones and convey it back to Earth; the landing drones would only have a
one way trip. The landing drones took soil, air and temperature samples
from Angharad, and a few flying ones measured wind strength and patterns
and made close inspections of the geography.

As all of this was promising (Angharad was full of promise), a human
survey team was then sent to visit the planet. These were highly
trained, specialised scientists who spent their lives shooting around
the galaxy. They were expensive, and only visited planets where
settlement was highly likely. They spent a month on Angharad, digging
through the soil, making assessments on geological formations and
mining, and determining the best place for settlement. They had noted
with particular emphasis the growth rate and verdancy of the native
plant species in almost breathless excitement for a survey report.
Angharad had been rated the highest of all known exoplanets on the
habitable scale.

On the strength of the survey assessment, NiñaPinta commissioned a ship
and began preparations for settlement. Potential settlers were sought
and, with their life savings, NiñaPinta outfitted the journey and took a
tidy profit for themselves. Jean herself had emptied her bank account,
sold her flat, her velotrike, and her interest in her father's old
company, and handed it all over to the smiling representative at
NiñaPinta. She wouldn't need money where she was going, after all.

The chartered ship left through the TTG. The journey took only a few
weeks - once the fabric of spacetime had been stretched in one direction
often enough, there was a "memory" of that journey that was left behind,
making the journey less energy intensive and quicker each time the same
path through space was made. The drones and the survey ship had
accomplished this for the *Hello and How Are You?*, and so the ship
skipped across space with no resistance.

It still took some months for the ship to move from its outer position
to the inner orbit around rocky Angharad, and during that time the crew
took stock of inventory, took measurements of Alnair B and its
surroundings, and oriented themselves in the galaxy. Once the ship
achieved stable orbit, the crew began reviving the initial settlement
party and stocking the landers.

At first, when the initial team landed, they were pleased. The soil was
as rich as advertised, the water as clear and pure, and the sunlight as
perfect as it could be for the growing of crops.

"So what is the problem?" Jean inserted at this point. "Was there a
mutiny?"

"No, or at least, that was not the main issue," sighed Captain Segard.
"A colony needs shelter, power, water and water treatment, waste
treatment, clean and fresh air, leadership structures, equipment, and of
course, food. We are having issues with the food supply."

"But it is perfect for growing crops?"

"Angharad is perfect for all plants. But mostly the native plants that
have been competing against each other for millions upon millions of
years. Plants on Earth have to contend with animals, so they have
developed strategies to deal with that, like toxins, thorns, and so on,
but native Angharad plants have only had to deal with other plants. They
are, in short, outcompeting our crops."

Jean frowned. "Outcompeting, like how?"

Segard shrugged. "The botanists know the details. I can forward these
for your review. However, the main issue is that we are struggling to
feed the colonists anything other than rations, corn and lettuce. And
until we do, we can't introduce many more colonists. It is mission
critical," he emphasised, "that a secure system of food production is
set up. We cannot leave a struggling band of colonists here to starve -
if we can't feed them, we will all need to return to Earth."

"Go back to Earth," Jean said blankly. "I'm not going back to Earth. I
just got here."

"We may not have a choice," he said.

She couldn't help herself - she felt her jaw firm up mulishly. *I have
to watch that*, she thought, and took a deep breath. "Then, could you
explain how I can help? I would\.... prefer... not to go back home."
*That was good. Mild, but got the point across.*

He considered her for a moment, and then leaned forward, crossing his
forearms on the table surface. "Miss Harrell, there are usually many
things that happen that are unexpected when settling a new planet.
Weather patterns, for instance, are something that all colonists need to
get used to, and we often get complaints about that. If there is animal
life on a planet, we will get many reports of animals acting in ways
that preliminary reports did not cover. And then there is the
paranormal, the feeling that the planet is not welcoming its new
populace. This manifests as reports of hauntings or mild hallucinations.
Usually all that is needed is time, and a calm discussion of what is and
is not possible. It is all part and parcel of the experiment that we
humans are conducting as we explore the galaxy. It's all part of the
guidebook, textbook really."

He looked down at the map again, and let out a breath slightly, not
quite a sigh. "About a year ago, Angharad Two began to report hearing
things. Not unexpected; it does happen, especially with fauna. This time
though, they are making recordings and sending them through. There is
something on those recordings, that's true, but as far as we can tell it
isn't anything other than random wind patterns through vegetation.

"However, it appears that most of the colonists in that location are
convinced that they are hearing entire musically coherent passages. I
suppose you could call them songs. They insist on this in every report,
and in almost every other communication I have from them." He waved at
his book. "I will send the recordings to you now."

She was shaking her head. "Entire songs... That's impossible to do
randomly. I think it's probably a prank that they are playing on each
other, or they perhaps need psychological assistance."

Segard nodded. "I am sure you are correct," he said. "I have listened to
the recordings and for the life of me I cannot distinguish any sort of
music, other than random tones. But..." and here he paused, and drummed
his fingers on the table briefly. Not understanding the input, his book
emitted sparkling bits of light, which he ignored. "I don't want to
appear superstitious about this," he said eventually. "I'm not a
superstitious person. I don't believe in ghosts, or\... or fairies, or
aliens. And the settlers - the heads of the settlement and their
reports - are not superstitious people either. Quite the opposite; their
bios are all of highly trained, serious individuals. And given the, ah,
delicacy of the situation, and the... well, the continued need for a
strong working relationship, the crew as a whole believe it would be
counterproductive to send anyone with a psychotherapeutic background to
investigate. It would send the wrong message."

Her brows knitted together. It was hard to be objective and listen to
his words evenly, given the damnable itching of the cuffs, and it was
even harder to think of what to say. However, he paused for so long that
she eventually had to venture a weak, "Why me? Why not some other
professional?"

He shrugged. "We had a few other options, but none suitable. We have the
same problem as with the psychotherapist. For instance, if we sent a
xenobiologist, the settlers would immediately believe we suspected alien
life was at fault. If we sent a climatologist, they would immediately
think we were biassed - that we weren't taking them seriously. There is
no way out of it. We have enough problems without calming those
suspicions as well.

"Which leaves investigating the nature of the music itself, and you have
the strongest background in music of all of our colonists. All we need
is someone to travel to the planet, hear the noise first hand, and
report back that these are random sounds produced by nothing more than
wind."

He paused and looked around. Surprised, she did as well - the blue
galley room was clear of people and the coffee pot steamed on its plate.
The sound was still deadened so she could not hear any of the usual
background hum of the ship, but she felt no vibrations in the floor that
would warn her of approaching crew members.

Segard made a small movement, which she thought was probably telling his
book to stop recording, since the sound break still remained in place.
He confirmed this by saying, "This next bit is off the record."

Jean sat up straighter, and he gave her a pained smile. "It's not bad,
don't worry. I just want to say that I don't want to send a
professional. I don't want more professional reports couched in
carefully scientific language that I have to guess the true meaning of,
or worse, ask someone to translate for me. I want you to send me a short
message every day in plain language about what is going on in Angharad
Two. Tell me anything you find that you consider strange, anything at
all, even if you think it's insignificant."

"You want me to spy for you?" she asked in some disbelief.

She had surprised him into a laugh. "I wouldn't say spy. No. Just...
tell me what you find there. Everything. I saw your application essay.
Just report to me like that, informally. We'll set up a secure channel,
and no one else will see it but me."

Captain Segard waved a hand through the projected map. "We've got
cameras and recordings, but I still feel very blind up here. I need to
know how things are actually going. I need to have a layperson's
assessment along with all these reports. It's critical. We're going to
have to make a decision shortly. We need to make some real changes if we
want this colony to develop to a point where we feel comfortable sending
down all the other settlers and going back home."

At this, her eyes lifted to search his face. There had been a strange
tone to his voice at the end, but looking at him, she couldn't tell
whether it had been impatience, homesickness, or plain weariness.
Perhaps it was all three.

There was a clear note of irritation evident when he added, "And don't
forget to tell me if it rains."

She retreated back to the sensory chamber, and called up the previous
programme. Weightless and comfortable again, she stared sightlessly into
the starfield, her hair spilling out around the sides of her face like a
sunflower.

Jean suspected she had agreed to Captain Segard's terms rather hastily.
She was aware of her anxiety that she would never reach the surface of
Angharad, and thought darkly that the captain had used it against her.
She couldn't make a living playing music in her old home - never could,
if she was honest with herself. If she taught, she would have to teach
music theory. She could no longer demonstrate effectively.

She grimaced. Maybe with a tin whistle. Could she teach with a tin
whistle? Or a set of pan pipes. Or possibly a trumpet...

Irritated at her limitless capacity for hope, she kicked her right foot
out, which caused her to start spinning. Dizzily, other parts of the
starfield came into her view, and then her eyes swept over the nighttime
surface of Angharad. There were no lights from cities to alleviate the
blackness, although a bright rim of sunlight was starting to creep over
the horizon. Her useless leg and arm stuck out gracelessly. They were
still annoyingly warm, which she tried to ignore.

She would go to Angharad, and she would give it her best effort to
understand what these people were thinking constituted "songs". She
would work on the machines, and try to make farming a little more
productive. If she had to survive on corn and chicken her whole life,
she would.

"I want to see the data packet from my meeting with Captain Segard," she
told her book, which obligingly lifted from the bookplate and joined her
in the middle of the chamber. Her preferred format for data packets was
a neat leather concertina briefcase, which now appeared in front of her,
hanging in space many thousands of kilometres above Angharad. She
reached out to it. Her book created small electrostatic fields in the
air that provided her some haptic feedback as she touched it, and her
book also transmitted a satisfying audible snap when she opened the
clasp. When she drew out the paper, it was heavy against her fingers.
The hologram was impossible to confuse with the real thing, but it was
close.

She swatted her stiff left arm in the air a bit to stabilise her
rotation and paged through her medical file. It was not illuminating,
having been written in medical jargon for the most part. She did,
however, glean that her situation was much as Captain Segard had said.
The medical staff (Steff) on the *Hello and How Are You?* were of the
opinion that it was her condition at the time of hibernation that caused
the issue. *Of course they would say that*, she thought sourly. They
would be protecting themselves and she wouldn't be able to get a second
opinion, in the location she was in.

*Although,* Jean thought, fairly, *there wasn't much to be done about it
in any case.* She couldn't bring suit against NiñaPinta because there
wasn't a functioning court system on Angharad, and she doubted she would
get a fair trial even if there was. If she bothered doing anything at
all, she would have to rely on internal grievance protocol, which she
had no confidence in.

She pushed the paper back in the briefcase, which obligingly switched to
the next folder. She withdrew a thick sheaf of paper that held rain
records and food yields. She noticed without surprise that the technical
language was nearly impenetrable, and stuffed it back into its folder.

The next folder held a music book, her preferred format for song
storage. She drew it out and "set" it down on her right knee, opened to
the first page. It was a moderately thick volume, and inside its cover
was a list of ten tracks. She knew that if she paged through the book,
she would find a musical notation of a machine transcription of each
track. Machine transcription of music was never perfect, but she enjoyed
having it in any case. It made the music seem more real to her.

The names of the tracks were just times, dates and location codes in two
short numbers which she recognised as latitude and longitude. Each of
the recordings were about ten minutes in length.

Jean thought for a second. "Simulation," she said. "Surface of Angharad.
No sound."

Instantly, she was floating above a small pond, the water so clear she
could see every curled leaf of the plants under the surface. Ringed
around the pond were thick grasses much taller than she was, some with
exotic seeds and leaves, mostly green but also some deep purples and
reds. The grasses bent in waves as the silent wind blew over them. Above
her was a blue dome, the virtual sun beating down on her without heat.
The simulation was extremely bright and it took a couple of minutes for
her eyes to adjust enough to read the music book again. She noticed idly
that the sensory room had even simulated her shadow across the waters of
the pond -- an odd shadow with limbs sticking out every which way. Her
lips twitched into something like a smile.

Once she could see again, Jean touched the title of the first track. Her
book directed playback into her ears, with clarity but just a little too
loud. She motioned downward until it was a reasonable volume, and then
touched the track again to restart the recording.

At first there was only wind. Then there was a voice - a male voice -
medium timbre, with a rough edge. "It should start up again in a
moment," he said. "It takes a couple of minutes sometimes."

The voice fell silent again, and listening to the winds of Angharad she
couldn't help but automatically consider what his vocal range would
likely be, and whether he might have a good singing voice. Most of the
time rough voices didn't have much strength without training, but
sometimes people surprised her.

Then she pictured the man standing under a tree canopy, or in the
tramped down grasses beside the pond, with his book circling him and
recording. How strange would it be to be in such a quiet place, all
alone, with no one for hundreds of kilometres, listening for an alien
song?

Then she heard - something. Faint, and brief. Without thinking, she
leaned forward, tilting her head. The man said, quietly, "Here it is."

She strained her hearing. She thought she could hear a murmuring, a
sighing, just slightly louder than the wind. Was that it? She stilled
her breathing as much as possible and closed her eyes. Still, she could
hear nothing more than a gentle susurrus. *There could be poor
acoustics*, she thought. *Poor recording equipment.* It was difficult to
record sounds, especially in the open air.

A few minutes later the man said, "That's it for now I think. I'll try
to catch it again later." And that was the end of the recording.

Flummoxed, she listened to it again, louder this time. And a third time,
louder, asking her book to play the track through the chamber's own
system. The soft walls of the sensory chamber couldn't dampen the harsh
nature of the man's voice or amplify whatever noise she was hearing
above the wind.

She ran the track through an audio analysis programme, asking it to
isolate the sound of the wind from the noise. She looked at the
resulting frequency spectrogram in frustration, and then tried to use
some algorithms to sharpen the result. There was definitely something
there, a residual hum, rising and falling and breaking in waves. What
wasn't there, was a pattern. If there wasn't a pattern, it wasn't music.
This seemed like enhanced background noise.

The rainbow of the spectrogram didn't give her any clues, and she
cleared it away with a quick gesture. The music book was still sitting
weightlessly on her knee, and she touched the next track, hastily
reducing the volume again.

The same man's voice cut in, in the middle of a sentence. "\-- been
following us all morning," he said. "Hasn't let up once."

A woman's voice then, a strong alto, businesslike but seeming strained
to Jean's ears. "It's every time we stop for five minutes. It stops when
we're walking."

"That's true," the man said, hesitantly. "But we might not be able to
hear it when we're walking because we're making too much noise.

"No, it definitely stops," said the woman. "It stops whenever we make
noise. It's stopped right now, since we're talking. Haven't you
noticed?"

There was a pause. "Okay, let's test it," said the man. They both fell
silent.

While they were speaking, Jean was directing her book to run more sound
analyses on their voices and the background noise. This time she asked
for a plain audio spectrum, where she could see the amplitude and
frequency of the sound. Their voices were easy to see against the
background static of the wind. When they stopped speaking, the readout
(which had taken the form of a bright green line in a black cube)
reduced to just the wind, rising and falling in strength with the volume
of each gust.

And then there was something, again, just raising the amplitude
slightly. Just enough that Jean could see it with her unassisted vision,
and hear it above the background noise. She tried cancelling out the
earlier wind sounds, but the readout then crawled along with hardly any
variation. She had her book make the spectrum much larger, but it didn't
help.

A few minutes later, the woman said, "It's so pretty. Don't look at me
like that, Daren. It is beautiful."

"What it is, is impossible, Hesta," said Daren. "There's nothing here
that could make a noise like that. We've been all over this area.
Nothing looks like windchimes, or pipes, or bottles."

"It could be high tension blades of grass," said Hesta. "You know, like
when we were children and we held blades between our fingers\--"

The recording stopped, and the green line in the audio spectrum
flattened to nothing. The pond and grasses were shining and moving all
around her, eerie in the silence. Jean looked up at the simulated sky,
brought her good knee up against her chest, and circled it with her good
arm, locking it in place with a hand around the opposite, cuffed arm.
Her skin prickled with the pressure and she couldn't help thinking about
the thousands of tiny needles bending in her flesh.

"Lynn," her book announced.

She cursed. "Quit programme," she said, and reoriented herself in the
sudden blank whiteness of the room. This time, she didn't stumble.

Half a second later the door whooshed open and Lynn entered briskly - or
as briskly as she could, given the softness of the cushions. She didn't
come far into the chamber, lingering by the door.

"Jean," she said. "It is nice to see you. It has been a few days." She
was using her gentle and soothing voice, which immediately annoyed Jean.

"Yes," said Jean.

Lynn, of course, could hear the irritation, and in response smiled
comfortingly. "I am glad to see that you are up and about so much
lately. I've heard that Steff gave you a cane. That might help with your
mobility, I should think."

Jean looked to the right of the door, where the cane was leaning, and
tried not to frown. "You've heard that, have you."

"Steff sends me updates occasionally," Lynn said. There was a slightly
breathy quality to her voice as well, that Jean strongly suspected was
forced. Her body was neat and trim, her shipsuit always looked pressed
with care, and no hair ever dared to be out of place. Lynn was a
consummate professional. Someone that anyone could trust. A perfect
liaison between a company and its settlers.

Jean shrugged. "I suppose I can't stop him."

Lynn smiled, but her eyes weren't amused. "I do need to know everything
about the people in my charge," she said. Her voice was carefully clean
of any judgement - a pure statement of reason. It might have impressed
Jean if she had been in a better mood.

Jean frowned and shifted her weight on the soft padding. Her leg was
getting tired of standing on the yielding surface already. "Was there
anything I could help you with? I was in the middle of something."

"A couple of things," Lynn said, with a decisive nod.

Jean sighed. "Well then, I think we should go to the common room."

"Of course," said Lynn, and opened the door for her, nimbly getting out
of Jean's shambling way and letting her take the lead down the hall.

There were few places on the ship for settlers to relax. There was the
mess hall, the sensory chamber, and two small common rooms for
gatherings. The *Hello and How are You?* was not meant to be a passenger
ship. Settlers were to wake, undergo a three day orientation, and then
be transported to the surface. They were to be woken in small groups of
thirty or forty, and therefore each common room was only large enough
for four small tables, a couple of desks, and an entertainment centre
that dropped from the ceiling for vids or music. The materials in each
room were strictly utilitarian and plain white and blue.

Jean plunked into a chair, putting her cane between her knees. Lynn
gracefully slid a different chair away from the table and angled it
towards Jean. She perched on the lip of the seat, delicately crossing
her legs and lacing her fingers over her knee. Her posture was
calculated to make Jean feel that Lynn was acutely interested in her and
everything she had to say. Lynn's book hovered above her head, eager to
help. Jean eyed her with dislike.

"I hear that you've been cleared to land on Angharad," Lynn said
approvingly. "That's excellent news. I'm sure you are happy. You've made
such good progress."

"Yes," Jean said.

Lynn waited for a fraction of a second to see whether that was all Jean
was going to say, and then, cheerfully, continued. "In which case, we
need to carry out the second part of your orientation. That involves
some more training vids, which you can view right here."

"Oh, I see," Jean said.

"Or in your room, if you'd like. I'll send through the vids and you can
watch them at your convenience, as long as you view them before you go
down."

Jean shifted her weight, stretching her stiff leg out. "Thanks."

Lynn paused, and Jean waited. Eventually she said, "They aren't very
long, and you will probably find them a little boring as they are much
the same as the vids you watched before the journey here. But it is a
requirement and you should pay as much attention to them as you can.
They might be vital to your life on Angharad."

"Okay, I'll watch them. Thanks."

She hesitated again, and Jean waited. Eventually Jean said, "Was there
something else? Like I said, I was in the middle of something."

Lynn laughed. It was a light laugh. "It's only about your breathing
mask. You are aware that NiñaPinta recommends a breathing mask for your
first week planetside?"

A breathing mask? Jean couldn't remember much about that. She was sure
she'd read about it somewhere, but it hadn't seemed important at the
time. It had been less than a footnote in some of the training brochures
and no one had mentioned it to her verbally. She'd completely forgotten
about it. "Yes," she said slowly.

It may have been her imagination but Lynn's smile looked a shade more
brittle. "Our policies suggest that you wear your mask at the time you
leave the shuttle and always have it in place when you are outdoors on
Angharad. This is still our policy, and you will find this in the vids.
However, we are unofficially recommending more extensive use of the
breath masks."

"Really," said Jean, her eyebrows climbing. "How much more extensive?"

"We would - prefer - that you wear your mask for as much as possible,
for as long as possible. Most people initially feel that masks are
uncomfortable but they shortly get used to the feeling and taste of
filtered air."

"Even inside?"

"Yes, inside as well. Everywhere you go." Lynn was all smiles, now. "As
you know, your accommodation will be sterilisable. We suggest that you
run the sterilisation programme every day before you take your mask off.
We also recommend that you wear the mask before you get on the shuttle
to embark on your trip to Angharad."

Jean shook her head. "Is there something wrong with the atmosphere on
Angharad? I thought it was better than Earth's."

Lynn leaned a little forward. "Oh yes, it is better. Cleaner and nicer
in every way. A little more oxygen perhaps, but fresh and wonderful.
Much better than the air in here," and she gave a little wave.

"Then why...?"

Lynn smiled again. "It is nothing really. Our policies are adequate, but
using your breath mask more extensively may be considered best practice.
That is why I am bringing it up now. Our scientists on the surface seem
to believe that the pollen could cause some issues with some people who
might be sensitive to the native plants. It's difficult to tell who
might have these sensitivities beforehand, of course."

Jean studied Lynn, looking at her open, pseudo-honest face, her
carefully considered posture, the hair that was always immaculate. "I
see," she said.

"If you have questions, you can always speak to the scientists on
Angharad Two, where I understand you will be settling. They will have
more information on the pollen - they may be able to tell you whether
you have a sensitivity. You might be able to go without a mask within a
week."

Lynn waved to her book. "I'll have a mask delivered to your room. All of
your kit, your settlement kit, will be on your shuttle with you, and
things like clothes and food are already in place at Angharad 2. We
would usually put your mask with your kit, but you won't be able to
access it in flight, and of course we want you to wear it before
boarding your shuttle."

"Thank you," said Jean.

"That's it I think. Please do watch your vids. They are helpful for your
orientation and will get you in the right frame of mind to embark on
your new adventure. And best of luck - I'm so pleased that you made it
this far!"

After a few more good wishes that Jean shrugged off, Lynn left the room
with promises to check on Jean in the next few days, which Jean
acknowledged with a pained half-nod.

Jean sat in the quiet room for a while, fiddling with her cane and
letting her arm hang down uncomfortably. Her gaze went to the ceiling,
where she could see the outline of the stowed entertainment centre. Lynn
always made her feel like a grouchy lump. Jean didn't trust her at all.
But this sounded like something that was far more important than it
would first seem.

Breathing masks, music, and rain.

What else was there to know about Angharad?

Her cabin was a small room close to the med bay. Settlers usually stayed
in what was called the barracks, large open rooms with bunks and
individual lockers. This was only for able-bodied settlers who could
easily climb up and down the bunks and open lockers without help. She
had investigated the barracks, previously - they were eerie when empty,
with rows of stacked beds closely placed together.

Jean's cabin was for people receiving medical attention, and was bare of
everything but a bed and a simple fold-out desk and chair, with a
generous space in the middle for medical equipment. Everything was in
clean, simple white. The only thing it offered was privacy.

The desk had been folded down, and a thin circlet had been placed on it.
The breathing mask.

Ignoring this, she sat on the bed and gestured to her book. The lock on
the door briefly glowed red as her book activated the privacy controls.
Jean sighed, and leant back on the sleeping mat. The tissue-thin
blankets rucked up under her shipsuit in an uncomfortable way. She hoped
that there were better blankets on Angharad Two, and, just for a moment,
felt a happy glow that she was finally going to go. She was finally,
finally going to go.

Stretching, she waved her cuffed arm in the air, and her book spun
around in response. Amused, she waved her other arm, which made her book
spin around in the opposite direction. She laughed, for the first time
in years. It came out more as a cough.

She watched her book go to the bookplate, and wondered idly whether the
colony on Angharad would be able to keep up with new book technology.
The tech community had been excited for several decades about the
evolving nature of books. It was a lot of babble that she hadn't been
very clear on, but she had an idea that the tech experts considered that
all of the evolving and condensing of algorithms and the revolutionary
gravity technology that went into the central chips of the books was
approaching some sort of tipping point.

She couldn't follow all of their arguments, but they were saying that
the inner workings of books were becoming almost unreal in a concrete
way. In one or two more iterations, the central chip would become pure
energy that was folded and compressed into such a dense state that
physics would break. The core part of books would become a sort of
collapsing quantum foam that could still think - and if that happened -
the philosopher-techs insisted that they would become more than just the
material they were made from. Books already seemed to read minds and
anticipate wants. What more could they do?

Jean held out her hand and her book flew over to land on her palm like a
butterfly. She could feel a small hum from the energy it contained.

It was a beautiful thing, one of the gemstone models that were in vogue
decades before she left Earth on the *Hello and How Are You?*. Most
books were plain black or a single precious metal. Not this model.
Machine-created gemstones had been cut like stained glass and pieced
together with gold to form a colourful beetle-like shape. Inside was a
bright spark that shone through the gems. It had been an expensive gift
from her mother when she was seven - old enough to graduate from the
simpler and more sturdy baby books.

"Let's see those training vids," she said. Her book rose without fuss
from her hand and started the projection. She watched for three minutes,
eyes half-closed, before cutting the vid off with an abrupt gesture.

Jean chewed her lip. The sterile white of the room was so blank that the
walls almost disappeared when she unfocussed her eyes. Something was
bothering her, and had been bothering her since the captain spoke about
it.

Eventually, she addressed her book. "What I really want to know," she
said, "is what delusions previous settlers may have had when colonising
planets."

That took some explanation. At first, her book just wanted to show her
vids that were fictional in nature with such titles as *The Bloodbath*
or *Fever on Fenethrau*. She had once liked such things but now they
just seemed ridiculous. The book displayed this for her as a selection
of rotating cubes, a vid on each surface. She brushed them all aside.

"No, no," she said. "I want studies. Personal anecdotes. Vids or
reports, anything like that."

Jean filtered studies on mental illnesses and medical issues related to
hibernation - there were many more of those than she would have
expected, but then again, hibernation had been dangerous for quite some
time - and anecdotes that were clearly not from anyone who had ever
visited a different planet.

There were two instances of mass hallucinations that had occurred in
space stations. She had heard of one of them - the famous spiders of
Gemini Tau, a small Chinese asteroid mining and research habitat. The
crew members saw spiders at the edges of their vision for weeks before
they found the causal agent, a species of yeast that had infested the
food. Several of those fictional vids had been based on that mass
hallucination. She found the original vids from the space station and
watched them thoughtfully, her book translating their speech as close to
the sound of their voices as possible. The most interesting thing, she
thought, was that most of the people started seeing spiders after they
were explicitly asked if they had been seeing them. The academic reports
put it down to suggestion.

The other one was due to carbon monoxide poisoning and was easily
treated once the medical team caught on. Only one person came close to
dying. This happened on a ship that had re-entered from slingspace in an
uncontrolled way, causing several mechanical problems and loss of
failsafes. There were no vids associated with that one, merely news
reports that had quickly been forgotten about.

"How about reports from the surface of planets?"

The cubes were black, and she had the feeling her book was puzzled by
her question. She tapped her fingers on her bed, the plasticy blankets
crinkling at the movement. Her other hand was still, but hot and itchy.
"Maybe I don't want studies, news and reports. Maybe more... theoretical
than that. Find me something like a philosophical treatise on mental
adjustments that settlers have to make on alien planets. Including the
fantastical. I seem to remember that the captain referred to ghosts."

That was a minefield. The cubes were now full, sparkling as they floated
between her and the ceiling. She reached up to sort through the cubes.
Most of the more fantastical vids were fiction, which she eventually
removed.

Others were bright and angry, shouting at her with lurid colours. "Man
is not meant to take over the galaxy!" said one, before she could
dismiss it. "We are changing the order of things!" another frothed, the
speaker's face far too close to the recording machine, and therefore
only a few centimetres from her own. "Whatever civilisation - whatever
history - that may have happened has now been supplanted with our own!"
She batted that one away reflexively, her hand moving through the man's
cheek without resistance.

There were many more serious people saying the same things, in less
inflammatory ways. Jean had heard that environmentalist perspective
before. Humans had been given one planet and were still in the process
of ruining it. Now they wanted to ruin others, and stop evolution in its
tracks. No matter what environment humans moved to, they would be taking
part of Earth with them and grafting it in whatever amenable soil they
found. The natural world would yield before that, powerless to fight
back. Then the humans would spill over the new world, removing all the
native species, and all of the natural resources. Even if they left -
even if they replaced all the native species and removed all of the
microscopic life that humans carried with them - a new civilisation
would never have the resources to naturally develop as it would have
done had humans not set foot on the planet.

Jean, however, knew just how countless the stars were in the sky, and
how countless the expected number of habitable planets there were in
just the Milky Way galaxy. Thousands of planets awaited them just in
local space. Slingshot drives couldn't span the huge gulfs of space
between galaxies yet but it was theoretically possible, and given enough
time, humans would make it happen. It was impossible for humans to wipe
out all life. They were too small, too fragile, and gave birth too
infrequently to even try. Maybe on a single planet... but they hadn't
even managed to do that to Earth yet.

"Okay, just isolate it to ghosts," she said, and her book somersaulted
before displaying more vid cubes.

Now the vids referred to dead or dying civilizations that humans may
destroy without intent. The speakers tried their best to impart an aura
of authority or sincerity as they described scenes of gore and loss,
grief and a haunting feeling that drove the settlers to insanity. "A
cautionary tale," one of them said, a smirk on her face, "a lesson not
to interfere with things that we do not understand."

Jean rolled her eyes and waved all of it away. "Not helpful," she said
to her book. "The captain said it was part of the guidebook. I don't
remember it in the guidebook. Show it to me, in writing - I can't be
bothered with vids at the moment."

The guidebook materialised in front of her, in a format that looked like
paper. If she sat up, it would become a full book that she could page
through. Instead, she tucked her good hand under her head and scanned
the page above her. Her book watched her eyes and flipped the pages when
it was time, or skipped ahead to sections when she looked at the section
markers.

There it was - "When you reach your new home, you will be amazed by your
changed life and gorgeous surroundings. Every morning will be special
and new. We call this period of time *habituation* and you can expect it
to last six to eight months. Most of the time habituation is a happy
period where you will find rewarding work, meet amazing new people, and
delight in the natural world. However, you may miss your home on Earth
and the people there, and you might, without meaning to, subconsciously
reject this world you have come so far to live in. This is entirely
natural and expected, and we will support you in whatever way we can.
Please speak to your passenger liaison at any time." Behind the text was
a beach scene with a ridiculously beautiful sunset, so bright that
Jean's little cabin glowed orange and pink. The waves curled silently
toward a dark beach, ending at her bedside.

That was it. Nothing on the next page, nothing on the page before it,
nothing in the index. Asking her book to show her anything regarding
habituation with settlers only resulted in vids that covered the time it
would take for a settler to begin work and get comfortable. Jean sent
her book back to the bookplate and frowned.

The people on the Angharad recording seemed convinced that they were
listening to music. Even so, Jean had almost believed the captain when
he suggested that they were delusional. Perhaps it was something like
the yeast infestation - but in that case, wouldn't they have instantly
detected a contaminant like that, given they knew about the previous
incident?

She would just have to go down there and see for herself, she thought.
And tried not to feel inadequate for the task.

Five interminable days later, she was in the medbay again, seated on the
cold table, watching Steff flip through the pages of her latest scan.
The two cuffs had hardened in the intervening days to the point where
she could barely flex her knee and elbow, and she was heartily sick of
them. Her leg stuck out from where she sat and she uncomfortably rested
her arm across her lap.

In the meantime she had watched training vids and tried to research
inexplicable phenomena on planets, and when she couldn't tolerate that,
she used the sensory chamber as a sort of meditation room. When she had
to, she drug herself along the blue corridors, stamping down with her
cane and swinging her leg out gracelessly. When she could no longer
avoid the mess hall, she would quickly grab a packet of food and tote it
in an ungainly fashion back to her cabin. It felt like a long five days,
and she couldn't believe that it was over.

"There was a response," Steff announced, finally. Jean broke off her
thoughts and stared at him.

"How big of a response?"

Steff grimaced. His eyes looked towards the ceiling, his hands still on
the readouts, lit from underneath by the projections. Not for the first
time, she thought: *Piano hands.* "It's difficult to say exactly. I
believe there was a response because there does appear to be improved
function that probably isn't just your body healing itself over time.
And it's a higher response than we get only from treatment. So by that
metric, I would say the cuffs improved things. But Jean... don't get
your hopes up. The response is small."

"Okay. How small?"

"In the order of 5% increase in remaining function. Your nerves just
aren't working well with your muscles. You'll find your symptoms and
mechanical responses improve over time, but I think... you should be
prepared, Jean. It will take a lot of time, and effort on your part.
You're going to have to be very diligent about the exercises I will give
you. But no matter what, you won't get it all back."

She dropped her eyes. "How much will I get?"

Steff sighed. "I don't want to encourage you. But, in these kinds of
situations, in a few years you might find that you have about 70% of
what you had originally. You'll be stronger, but you won't have
extremely fine motor control."

Jean was silent. Steff waited a bit, and said, "Let's get those cuffs
off, anyway. Hold out your arm first."

"But... they're working," she protested. "Can't we leave it a bit
longer?"

"Hmm," Steff said. "Um, I'd rather take them off now. You see, the cuffs
work by creating tiny micropunctures in your skin. Each of those
micropunctures can be a way for foreign bodies to enter the body. You
see," taking a teaching tone, "your skin does an excellent job of
keeping anything that's not you, out of you. But if we artificially
create a hole, anything can enter. And we're not 100% sure of what's on
Angharad, so the fewer micropunctures we have in our skin, the better."

Jean reluctantly held out her arm. "But surely all of those
micropunctures exist right now? Does that mean I shouldn't go?" *Of
course, something small like this will stop me. All this way, and so
close, and of course something will get in the way.*

"Oh no," he said, gripping the tip of the cuff tightly. She could feel
it even through the stiffness of the fabric. "Your body will have
absorbed all of those needles by now - well, most - but we can deal with
that. Hold still."

He whipped the cast off her arm like a magician. It was so swift she
didn't even blink. He had a bit more trouble with the leg, but
eventually it also came free. While Steff went to dispose of the cuffs
and rummage through some boxes, she flexed her arm and leg slowly. They
felt light and airy, and were informing her in detail of the texture of
the inside of her shipsuit, which was cold without the insulating cuffs.
She opened her hand as far as she could, and tried to bend each finger
individually. Jean couldn't tell the difference from before.

Studying her hand, she said, "So why are you worried about foreign
bodies on Angharad? I thought there was no life on the planet other than
plants. I thought that included microbial life as well."

He hesitated, one arm deep inside a box. Then he continued to look
through the items inside, pushing bits aside. "Well, yes. As far as we
know. But it is a foreign planet, you know, and I prefer to be cautious
about these things."

He came back to the table with a small stack of what looked like thick
paper. "Gel bandages," he said, and smiled briefly. "Waterproof,
airproof, and foreign body proof. There's a few places where you may
have needles remaining. I'd like to protect those places, so please roll
up your sleeve and leg."

She did so, and he applied the gel bandages. They were initially cold to
her sensitive skin, but almost immediately warmed and felt like nothing.
Each was about the size of her hand. He applied five, two on her arm and
three on her leg.

Steff patted the last one. "Leave these on for at least 24 hours - I'd
prefer more, but that's up to you. Just no more than three days, because
your skin has to breathe. They'll heal almost anything under them."

She stood up, steadying herself on the table, and then looked up at
Steff, at a loss for anything to say. His hazel eyes were kind, even if
it was an impersonal type of kindness. He had been there when she woke
up, and had patiently tried his best to calm her panic and heal her, she
thought. He was a genuinely nice person. She briefly wondered how much
of an irritant she had been. "Thanks," she said eventually.

"I hope everything on Angharad is as you want it to be," he said
seriously. "Good luck with it all. No - keep the cane. You might need
it."

She waved the medbay door closed behind her, took a breath, and steeled
herself. There was little left to do but go to the shuttle bay. This was
towards the front of the ship (*aft,* she corrected) and down one level.
She took a breath, and went.

It seemed like a long way, but also incredibly short. As she slowly
walked through the halls, Jean only felt a mild trepidation, which she
wondered at. She had anticipated feeling exhilarated, eager, joyful -
but she actually felt that things were happening too fast, and vaguely
unreal. The short drop in zero G was like she was breaking through to a
new place altogether, almost as if she didn't belong there, adding to
the sense of unreality. She'd never been past level two, where the mess
hall and medbay were.

There was a darker blue line in the cerulean of the passenger corridors,
labelled "Shuttle Bay", that extended all the way from the barracks with
chevrons indicating the direction, so that all the colonists in each
group could easily find their way to the waiting shuttle. Jean had
looked at this line longingly for weeks, and now followed it
unhesitatingly down the unfamiliar corridor, only using her cane
occasionally. She still had uncertain strength in her leg, and by the
time she had arrived at the pressure door, she was getting tired and
leaning on her cane more.

She paused, and reached her good hand into the neck of her shipsuit.
Jean had been repeating all of the warnings she'd received over and over
in her head, and had not forgotten Lynn's gift of the thin but sturdy
woven plastic and metal circlet of the mask. It draped around the back
of her neck and down her collarbones, open at the ends. At each end of
the circlet were two soft metallic beads that conformed to her skin.
When she pinched them together and held them for a few seconds, they
melted partially together, and the entire circlet settled against her
skin in an alarmingly firm way.

The barest hint of a field rose from this circlet, through the fabric of
her shipsuit and over her hair and face. It enclosed her entire head and
obscured her vision slightly, so that everything she looked at was as if
she viewed it over a hot surface - shimmery, she thought, and a little
strange.

She took a large breath, and could feel it being blocked partially by
the mask. At her nod, her book flew ahead and opened the pressure door
for her. On the other side was a long and thin room with an open airlock
on the far end. The airlock was small to Jean's eyes - she would have to
bend over to enter it, and she silently thanked Steff for the cane.

Lynn stood by the airlock, her tidy hair gleaming in the simulated
natural light. She was speaking to a thin and bright eyed woman through
the airlock. When Jean limped into the room, she broke off her
conversation. "Good morning, Jean," she said. "May I introduce you to
your shuttle pilot? This is Keta."

Keta looked Jean over, leaning slightly into the airlock. "Good, they've
told you about the mask," she said, indicating the field over her own
face and head. Suspicious, Jean darted her eyes briefly at Lynn, and was
surprised to see another thin shimmery halo. Just how toxic was this
pollen, if Lynn was so careful of even the air from the shuttle? "I'm
one of the two pilots on the shuttle today. Since there's only you,
we've filled the passenger area with supplies and food packets. Your kit
is back there too - we'll give it to you once we've landed. There's only
one seat in front of the webbing, so that one's yours. Once you're
settled, we'll get clearance to be off."

Jean nodded, and stepped forward with her cane. "Is it morning at the
landing area, then? I thought we were to arrive early."

Lynn looked at her book. "Oh yes. 04:00. It'll be 10:00 by the time you
arrive, however. Only six hours of travel time. We're in the best part
of our orbit for travel to the surface. Twenty-five hour days on
Angharad! You won't notice the difference after a few days."

"Another hour to sleep," said the pilot, laughing. "People do seem to
like it. If you'd like to come aboard, please do." Keta disappeared from
the airlock further into the craft, which Lynn could now see was full to
the brim with webbed goods.

Lynn watched her go, and then turned to Jean, who steeled herself. After
a brief pause, Lynn gave her a carefully calculated, rueful smile. "This
is usually the time I give a little prepared speech about your new life
and how much you're going to like it," she said. "Shall I just say,
instead, how much we have enjoyed having you aboard? It is so nice to
get to know one of our settlers better. We usually only have settlers on
board for three days, so we never really even get to know their names. "

"Oh, ah, thanks," said Jean stiffly.

"Not the best of circumstances for you, unfortunately, but you're now
cleared and all set to go. I hope you remember us in your new life!"

Jean could clearly hear the exclamation point. She shrugged. "Of
course."

"Now go ahead and get in. I will just stay out here... I'd have to run
the decontamination programme again if I showed you to your seat! But
it's right there to the left. Good luck with everything. Do let me know
if I can be of any help up here. Watch that step..."

With only the briefest hesitation, Jean ducked through the airlock,
using her cane liberally. She stood back up and turned to see Lynn
swiftly gesturing the lock to close. It did, with alacrity, and Jean
regarded the curved inside of the door with surprise. It was so abrupt,
so final. She had the impression that Lynn was as pleased to see her go
as she was to leave.

She found her way to her seat by skirting the mass of webbing. The
entire inside of the shuttle had been removed - seats, panels, and
partitions - to include as much cargo as possible. A little path led to
the side along the edge of the shuttle towards what presumably was the
front. *Aft.*

She'd never been on a shuttle before, not awake anyway. It was much
bigger than she would have thought inside. Shuttles weren't for long
term habitation, but most of them had sleeping compartments and food
preparation areas. They weren't capable of traversing slingspace, but
they did have nuclear propulsion systems and gravity drives that allowed
for speedy and efficient travel between planets and moons, as well as
between planets and orbiting bodies, like the *Hello and How Are You?*.
Some more efficient and shielded models could travel as far as the
asteroid belts, but any further than that and a ship with a slingspace
drive was necessary.

She found her seat in a bay that still had its partitions, angled to the
left and tucked against the side of the shuttle wall. The shuttle
narrowed here, eventually coming to a pointed, plane-like nose. In front
of her was a solid wall that probably had the control room on the other
side. Across from her seat was another partition, full of boxes and
secured by yet more webbing. Her book found a place on a large bookplate
on the ceiling.

The seat was deep and firmly cushioned, with strapping that held her in
at several points. She did her best with the straps, and awkwardly
placed her cane beside her seat. A few minutes later a crack appeared in
the wall to the control room and an oval door swung open, admitting
Keta, who sized her situation up carefully. "Looks good. You might find
it more comfortable if this strap, here, wasn't twisted around like
that. Excellent. We'll be leaving in a few minutes. Once we're away from
the ship, you can take off the straps. Try to get some sleep if you
can - that seat becomes a tolerable bed. I'll check on you in about an
hour."

Keta disappeared, the wall became impenetrable again, and Jean was alone
with her trembling heart. She swallowed. She could feel the pressure
from the containment field against her face and her hair, and from the
necklace itself as it lay over her collarbone. When she tried to scratch
her nose or to push her hair back, the feeling was blunted as if she was
wearing gloves.

It was already bothering her and she fought the urge to gulp for air.
*I'll get used to it,* she thought, a little desperately, then felt the
jolt of the shuttle separating from the ship and couldn't stifle a
little gasp.

In an instant, she pictured the shuttle, the aerodynamic, blunted and
curved-wing body of it, falling further and further away from the huge
barrelled body of the *Hello and How Are You?*, the space between the
two craft increasing inexorably, the perfect vacuum between the sealed,
curved airlock and Lynn's falsely smiling face expanding every second.
The airless nature of space impressed upon her in that moment, and the
confined mask echoed that oppression. She felt alone and small, and yet
her self and her surroundings - the webbing, the plain walls - were the
only things that she could sense in the empty partition inside the
shuttle. Her tiny world was bounded by the endless black nothingness.

The entire craft was spinning in space, even if she couldn't feel it,
and for a moment she was dizzy and tetherless. She gripped the seat
cushions and closed her eyes. *I'm not so sure humans were supposed to
do this. Maybe we should always be on Earth, where we were born*.
*Maybe... that's where we were supposed to stay.* At the thought, her
eyelids flew open again. That was what those environmentalists were
saying in the vids.

*But I don't really feel that way,* she thought, fiercely, to ward
against any delusional thinking. *If anything, I agree with the
territorialists, who say that the very uninhabitedness of the galaxy
means that we humans are supposed to go take it for ourselves. If! If
there was any meaning behind anything in any case.*

After that nihilistic thought, she felt better, and was able to release
the straps, fumbling a bit with her left hand which kept slipping off of
the fastenings. She had intended to take Keta's suggestion and activate
the seat's controls to see what kind of bed it could make, but stood up
instead. She was steady, so she left her cane on the ground. There was
no sensation of movement at all. The floor felt the same as it had done
on the *Hello and How Are You?*, and for that matter, the same as it had
done in her flat on Earth. She shook her head at her earlier
foolishness.

After a moment's thought - were they keeping an eye on her from the
bridge? - she crept to the webbing and inspected the contents. Across
from her seat, the webbed partition held plain reinforced boxes of
rations, clearly marked. The boxes were stacked four across, all the way
to the ceiling and presumably all the way to the shuttle wall.

She looked up at her book, which immediately floated down to her. "How
many days of rations is this?" she whispered. **Almost 7,000**, came the
answer in her vision, discreetly.

Jean turned to the bulk of the goods in the main passenger space. "And
how many in this?"

Her book flew away and returned. **More than 130,000.**

She didn't like seeing words projected directly in her vision from her
implants, which is why the book then highlighted the portions of the
goods that she could see with different colours and gave her a projected
readout of the contents of the entire load.

This shuttle was carrying food, medical supplies, replacement parts
which were difficult for simple fabricators to replicate, frozen
biological samples, and seeds. A bewildering variety of seeds. Her book
helpfully began to project a view of all of the plants that these seeds
would mature into as if they were growing from the floor. Jean didn't
recognise all of these plants, but she did know what corn looked like.
It was much taller than her, and the tilted elongated cylinders of the
ears were easy to identify. There was also rice, and the shorter thin
stalks of soybeans.

The projections faded and more took their place. Many looked identical
to the others. There was so much corn in particular that she took the
readout from its place in the air and paged through it. The reason why
there was so much corn, she discovered, was because each was a different
variety.

She put a finger on one at random. Immediately her book showed her the
projection, standing straight up from its roots in the shuttle floor. It
didn't look any different from any other stalk of corn. Frowning, she
said, "Tell me more about this one."

Her book presented her with only one answer; a paper written by a
graduate student less than six months ago. Jean couldn't read past the
first paragraph. "Summarise," she told her book, who changed the readout
to a single paragraph - it was an experimental variety, only newly
produced. So it was with the next few plants she tried. All were new
varieties, produced in the last year from research groups around Earth.

The captain had said that they were having difficulty growing food, that
the native flora were out-competing those from Earth. It made sense to
her, as she watched plants grow and fade away in the bright interior of
the shuttle, that they would then try to find varieties that were able
to compete on Angharad. She wondered whether NiñaPinta had purchased
seeds of all the new varieties to come to the market, or whether
NiñaPinta had commissioned these scientists to splice these plants to
Angharad's specifications.

Nothing else in the contents of the shuttle seemed interesting to her.
She recognised some of the machinery parts from her training, which
pleased her. At least she had retained some information from those
hurried study sessions... The biological samples were part of the
medical equipment which probably meant that they were intended for wound
repair.

The surfeit of food was the most worrisome aspect. There was more than
enough food to feed five hundred people for a year. And shuttles should
go down regularly, carrying both humans and cargo, at least twice a
week. Why would they provide so much food, all at once?

She returned to her seat, her face in an unconscious frown. Leaning
slightly forward, she wiped her hands through her hair in a blunted way,
and mused silently for a good twenty minutes. Her book circled around
her patiently but eventually settled back on the ceiling.

When she finally activated her seat's controls, it unfolded like a paper
fan, more material seemingly coming from nowhere. It made a narrow but
acceptable bed, almost perfectly level. Jean settled gingerly into it,
and snapped the single support strap over her body. It wouldn't do any
good if they crash landed, of course, but it made her feel more secure
even so.

She stared at the ceiling for a while, and then her eyes wandered across
to the partition on the opposite side of the shuttle. After a moment,
she thought, *At least if we're becalmed in the middle of space
somewhere, we won't starve to death.* Then she tried to get some sleep,
her book obligingly dimming the lights.

She didn't need the rest so she woke several times, each time coming to
an unpleasant realisation of where they were - thousands of kilometres
from any stable point in the universe - and then calming herself to try
to sleep again. Keta woke her a few times to be sure that she was okay,
which Jean didn't appreciate. Eventually she gave up and made the bed
fold itself back into a chair. The inside of her head was scratchy and
headachy when Keta finally announced that they were going to enter the
atmosphere soon.

Keta had also brought her a tray of food. "Usually we have the
commissary service bring this to settlers, but since it's just you,
we've shared one of our normal meals with you. It's a little better
quality than the meals we normally serve to settlers, so enjoy. I'll be
back to get the tray in ten minutes, then you should strap yourself in
again."

The food seemed basic to Jean - a cheese and grain bar, dried fruit and
a small packet of sliced meat. She finished it all, ignoring her stomach
that told her quite precisely that she wasn't hungry, and once again
handled the origami of straps. Keta was as good as her word, coming back
to retrieve the tray and telling her she had twenty minutes before
landing.

That meant that just now the shuttle was slicing through the upper
layers of the atmosphere, heating up remarkably quickly and leaving a
bright trace that people on the ground could see if they knew where to
look. It felt surreal to Jean, as the inside of the shuttle was as
sturdy as it had always been. She wondered when they would shut off the
false gravity, or if they had already.

False gravity was an artificial modulation of the Higgs field, and it
generally had two polarities in a directional way. These could be
manipulated to achieve any kind of gravitational effect desired
depending on the energy pushed into the field. The gravity in ships was
given by the field layer that lay inside the skin of the ship. This area
could be shielded by certain materials, which meant a ship could have an
anti-gravitational effect in the area around it, or not. Her book had a
dense gravitational field inside of a tiny sphere, but the opposite
effect had been weakened by materials in a filtered way, which could be
made directional, so her book could float in the air and move any
direction it wished by changing the composition of various parts of its
shielding material - or move fast when it wanted to.

Jean didn't pretend to understand the complexities of it, but she knew
when it was used. Right now the shuttle she was sitting in the belly of
was rocketing through cloud layers, but the interior of the shuttle was
utterly impervious to this. Only when the false gravity of the field was
taken away would she feel the rocking of the craft as it swooped through
valleys of air.

She waited for this, her good hand rubbing the knuckles of the slightly
numb one. She couldn't quite believe that she was about to walk onto the
surface of a planet other than Earth and that it was treated as routine
by everyone else. Perhaps if she had been sent planet-side with a cohort
of settlers like she should have been, everything would feel more
momentous. Her book dropped from the ceiling and hung close to her as if
it would reassure her.

After an interminable period of time she felt a soft jolt, too mild to
even disturb the piles of supplies around her. She looked around,
startled, but nothing seemed different. She was just starting to wonder
if she had imagined the whole thing when the slit in the cockpit wall
opened again and a man walked into the shuttle compartment.

"Welcome to Angharad," he said briskly. "I'm Arden, the co-pilot. We've
got to clear out the shuttle quickly so we can get the best return
flight back to the ship. I'll grab your kit and open the airlock while
you get your things together." He motioned to the straps and the cane,
which was still laying by the chair. He then gestured to her face. "Well
done for not taking that off. It's vital to be sure you've got your mask
on at all times." Then he passed by her and disappeared around the
webbing.

Stunned, Jean fumbled with the straps again hurriedly, which made her
left hand even more useless than it had been previously. She had to bend
twice to pick up her cane, and then stumbled to the airlock, which was
open and emitting fresh air, cooling the skin of her hands. It stopped
her in her tracks. It was light on the other side - a true natural light
she hadn't seen in weeks. She could see a ramp going down from the
airlock. She hesitated on the threshold, drawn towards the light.

Arden had been pulling the webbing down from where it hooked into the
ceiling, and now he turned to her with a large bag. "Can you handle this
with your other hand? No, I don't suspect it'll be easy for you.
Alright. I'll take your bag to the flyer pickup area, but I'm afraid
I'll have to hurry away immediately. We have to open the entire shuttle
to take all of this out, which means a lot of work for me I'm afraid. Go
on, I'll be behind you."

"Thank you," she said with a credible lack of shakiness. Then she ducked
into the airlock and headed down the ramp without stopping and looking
around, since she was so busy with her cane and lagging foot. The
daylight - actual bright daylight - produced real shadows that dropped
from her hands and her feet as she shambled, falling across the brightly
lit ground in a way that made her feel dizzy. She'd forgotten about
shadows.

And there... there it was, the wind. She could hear it, she could feel
it. It pushed against her, making walking even more difficult. The noise
from the wind rustled everything around her. It whistled, and murmured,
making its own high pitched song. Even the air inside her mask was
refreshed, with a scent that she couldn't identify. It was the scent of
green things, but also something that she had never encountered before -
a sweet metallic scent with a hint of a flower she knew but had lost the
name of.

At the bottom of the ramp she halted and finally looked up. Above her,
like the shout of a choir, was the sky of Angharad. It was impossibly
high and deep, a blue tinged with purple that was so glorious, so rich,
that she wanted to plunge her hands in it and feel its velvet texture.
The sky arched in an achingly beautiful way, as sweet as the sweep of
sound from a descending violin bow, to touch at its base a roiling mass
of green, surrounding her on all sides.

"Come on, this way," said Arden, who was closely following her and now
brushed past. "As quick as you can."

She tried to follow him while also keeping her eyes on her surroundings.
The hesitancy of her steps made this difficult, so she just caught
impressions, brief views of the world around her as she looked and
looked again. It was all green, a strange, varied green, in a shade that
was entirely unlike the plants of Earth yet obviously similar. It was
not a jewel green, but a green that had a lot of blue to it, stopping
short of teal.

There were some steps, which she navigated gingerly, putting her right
foot down first and then her left. *No more zero gravity shoots*, she
thought. Arden waited for her at the bottom, briskly nodding when she'd
made it.

"It's down here to the left," he said, indicating. "It's probably going
to be Haish who's here to get you. He's the transport specialist for all
of the colonies. The settlers are usually mixed between locations, you
know, so we have one group flight for everyone."

"Why don't they have automated flyers?" Jean asked. They were crossing a
wide platform under a light roof. The landing site didn't have its own
buildings, but it did have a covered waiting area. She glimpsed a small
flyer at the end of the platform, and a woman emerging from it.

"It's best to have someone actually greet the settlers," Arden said
absently, looking at the woman who was waiting for them. "I think this
is someone from Angharad Two. She'll be able to get you directly to your
colony."

He walked ahead, leaving Jean to slowly pick her way down to the end of
the flyer platform. She took the chance to look around. She could see
the top of the landing shuttle if she turned slightly, a silver
silhouette against the purplish sky, and a few large cargo machines
surrounding it. Everything else was made of stercrete, a puddle of
rock-like white surrounding the whole landing site in a circle of
perhaps half a kilometre.

At the end of the stercrete was a wall of bluish green, bright in the
sunlight. It danced with the wind that also blew against her, bowing and
nodding and scintillating with reflected light from the joyous jumble of
leaves. Her book was impervious to the wind, but her shipsuit moulded
against her torso and flapped against her legs.

"Jean - Jean. This is Monique. She's an irrigation design specialist
from Angharad Two. Monique, this is your new settler, Jean. Sorry - I do
have to go -" and he immediately turned to head back to the shuttle.

Monique stood by the open door of the flyer on the edge of the platform.
She waited for Jean to draw close, shaking her head at Arden's back. She
was tall with thick dark hair, severe eyebrows, and a sardonic
expression, clothed in simple fabricated belted tunic and trousers in
shades of brown. She picked up Jean's bag and raised those eyebrows. "Is
this everything?" Monique's voice was deep but laconic, with a tendency
to vocal fry.

"Everything that I've got with me," Jean said, after a pause. "Were you
expecting more?"

Monique shrugged. "I don't usually get sent to pick up new people. They
usually arrive by group flyer. I'm only here today because there's an
issue in Field 17 which needs everyone's help - everyone except
irrigation people, I guess. So anyway, I don't know what to expect. I
thought they'd be sending rations."

"I did see rations on the shuttle -" Jean began, but was interrupted by
a horrible, loud boom that echoed across the platform, reverberating
from every surface. It was a deep guttural explosion that was felt more
than heard.

She stood, shocked, thinking that something must have gone wrong with
the shuttle, until Monique caught her by the arm and dragged her away
from the flyer and further under the covered area. Jean stumbled, of
course, but Monique grabbed her under the arms and kept her upright.
"Sorry," the taller woman said, not sounding sorry. "We've got to get
under cover."

"What?" said Jean, bewildered.

They eventually came to a halt twenty metres away from the small flyer,
which still had its door open. Monique had left her bag beside the open
door. They were in the middle of the covered waiting area. Jean looked
around but nothing seemed to be changed. "What was that?" she asked
Monique.

Arden had jogged back. "Eh, I hate this," he said. "Worst possible
timing." Then he looked at his book and said, "Five minutes."

"That," said Monique to Jean, "is one of our amazing native plants
trying to kill us." Then she added to Arden, "It might be more than five
minutes. You never know."

Arden snorted. "Five minutes is more than enough. It doesn't have enough
propulsion to get very high."

Monique glared at him, but sighed, giving up and turning back to Jean.
"It's called a *horatia angharendis*. You get to know the biological
terms living here on Angharad. Everything's *angharendis* this,
*angharendis* that. The botanists are having the greatest time in their
lives, cataloguing everything that's trying to kill us."

"Nothing's trying to kill you," said Arden impatiently. "What a thing to
say to a new settler! It's just a plant trying to propagate," he said to
Jean.

"Yes, and the byproduct is two metre spikes," Monique said nastily.
"Shot from a biological cannon on regular intervals. They're clustered
around here thickly," she told Jean. "NiñaPinta must think it's funny to
put the landing area right here in the middle of it."

"It wouldn't be any better elsewhere," said Arden impatiently. "This is
the best location. Relatively low ground cover, best angle of orbit,
central to all the colonies. Anywhere else would be inefficient."

"Inefficient and maybe not covered in horatias," sneered Monique.

Then they both fell quiet, and looked up, listening. Jean gazed at both
of them in turn. Arden's face was set and annoyed, but also watchful.
Monique looked resigned, wary, and more than a bit angry. They were so
unfamiliar to her, their human faces under their masks, dark in the
shade of the platform roof, set against the blue-green of the encircling
plants and the purple sky of this thoroughly alien planet, that she felt
a little ill. She wondered what she thought she had been doing, coming
here. After a few minutes, Arden's book chirped.

"Good enough for me," said Arden. "If you want to stay here for a bit
longer, it might be best," he said to Jean. "This shelter is
specifically designed for these plants. Flyers aren't." He jogged away
again, his book following dutifully after.

"Should we stay?" asked Jean, hesitantly.

Monique was looking after Arden again, an unreadable expression on her
face. She glanced at Jean. "Our flyers do have shields," she said. "They
may not be purpose built, but we've adapted. We should probably get back
to Two."

In the flyer, with her cane between her knees in the co-pilot seat, and
feeling seriously lost at sea, Jean said, "What did you mean by two
metre spikes?"

Monique made a few final checks and unceremoniously pulled away from the
platform. The flyer tilted and lifted, the world spinning gently as they
banked over the stercrete circle. There was no false gravity on flyers.
It felt strange to Jean for a moment or two, but she remembered to look
at the horizon and eventually the familiar sensation of flyer travel
became normal again.

The purple-blue sky fell down to a clean cut of green along all sides.
They weren't at the right angle to look back towards the shuttle, so all
Jean could see was plant life as the flyer rose up above the highest
ones by more than a thousand metres. Flyers never reached high
altitudes, and they didn't travel fast, but they did get you there, she
remembered her father saying. It was exceedingly strange not to see
buildings underneath them as they flew.

"So the plants here don't make fruit," said Monique. "They don't even
really make seeds. They make something quite like seeds, but they
technically aren't, the botanists tell me. Don't ask me the details. I'm
an engineer."

"Are the spikes seeds?" hazarded Jean.

"Don't say I told you that," warned Monique. "But yes. Some plants use
the air for their seeds to travel. Some use water. Some use bloody great
big explosions and drive their seed straight through all of the
surrounding plants and whoever else might be close to it." She grimaced.
"And sometimes their explosions will set off other explosions nearby."

Jean stared at Monique. The woman's thin face was bathed in various blue
shades from the darkened front glass shield, which highlighted her high
cheekbones to the point of gauntness. "Are you saying people have been
injured?"

"Of course," said Monique, glancing sideways at her.

Jean's hands tightened on her cane. "What do you mean - 'of course'?"

Monique glanced at her again, for a little longer. Then she stared
straight ahead, her hands on the semicircle of the control panel in
front of her, her book presumably sending readouts directly to her
implants and taking care of the finer details of navigation. "NiñaPinta
knew about the flora on this planet. They had to know, they had all the
data. The initial survey team must have reported it... or if they
didn't, they need to be held accountable. And the worst part is that
they didn't tell you. They didn't tell any of us. You have to wonder
why. Don't you?"

Jean stared. "Tell me what," she said, flatly. She could distantly hear
the whine of the flyer's engine underneath her, and the wind as it
rushed over the carapace. They had settled into their flight path and
the light and shadow within the flyer had stabilised. She wondered
whether she could ask Monique to turn around and take her back to the
shuttle.

Monique's mouth thinned to a fine line and then she shook her head.
"They never told you about the horatias. Did they?"

Jean's eyebrows went up. "No. It might have been in the information
provided, but if it was, it was only a small reference."

"Do me a favour. Look at all the information they gave you, and tell me
if they mention anything about 'horatia'."

Jean shrugged, and waved at her book. As it sparkled and rotated to
acknowledge her command, she said, "I don't know much about plants. It's
not my interest. I'm actually here about music."

Monique's mouth twisted. "I heard you were a music teacher. Why they
sent us a music teacher, I'll never know. We don't need music teachers.
We need... Well, we need lots of things. More machines, more specialist
scientists. Miracles, maybe. Not teachers, for certain. You're... sorry.
But you're useless, to be perfectly honest with you." She shook her
head. "Another of NiñaPinta's little jokes."

In Jean's offended silence, her book let her know that there was no
mention of horatias in any of its databases. She blinked the information
clear, and said in measured tones, "I may be able to help with the field
machines. I have training for that."

Monique's eyes flicked towards her. "Silse will never let you touch any
of them. They're his babies. He'd never let anyone else within half a
dozen metres. Especially not someone who... well, isn't in great
condition."

Jean's jaw was so tight that she couldn't say anything. Eventually
Monique said, "Can you play the harp?"

Jean looked away, over the ocean of green. She managed to answer, "Not
with my hand like this."

"Pity," said Monique. "That's my favourite."

It was one of Jean's favourites, too.

A few minutes later, Monique mentioned that there was a new irrigation
schematic that she was working on, and if Jean wouldn't mind, she'd like
to devote the remaining hour of travel time to that. That was more than
agreeable to Jean, who didn't want to speak with Monique in any case.
Monique cleared the control panel and brought up a temporary desk, where
she began working with her book on what looked to Jean like a simple
grid of blue lines. Monique must be a person who liked to have more
information available through her implants, Jean thought. Monique's book
gave nothing away, being a discreet and boring flat black.

Jean turned her attention to the window once more. Flyers used
anti-gravity, but they had simple propulsion engines as well, which made
the craft hum underneath her. This flyer was much like her father's old
flyer - plain and dependable. It had adequate windows but nothing like
some of the more striking designs that were popular on Earth.
Nevertheless, it afforded her a remarkable view of the plain that
stretched out below.

She had learned some things from the training vids. The anvil continent
where the colony was placed was now called Lutha. The massive plain that
sat in the west side of the continent, south of the gentle mountains
that stretched almost all the way across the continent and dropped to
the south on the west side, was the Mauran Plain. In the middle of the
Mauran Plain was the landing pad. From the landing pad, Angharad One was
to the northeast, closest to the mountains, Angharad Two was due west,
and Angharad Three and Four were close to each other, one
south-southeast, one east-southeast. Angharad Three lay on the alluvial
plain of a great river - the River Tor - that meandered south from the
lip of the mountains and down to the southern sea. All of these names
had come from old legends Jean was unfamiliar with.

It was one thing, however, to look at a map and the outlines of
continents and oceans, but another to be hanging in the crystal clear
air above a never ending layer of blue-green. Angharad spun in space the
same way that Earth did, for the most part, so with the sun behind them
it didn't dazzle Jean at all to gaze raptly into the distance to the
west.

Far along in the distance she fancied that the darker blue line on the
horizon was the mountains. As she gazed down she saw the vegetation
wasn't as unbreaking as she thought - occasional ribbons of streams and
rivers caught the passing light and reflected it back to her, glinting
shyly between layers of leaf cover. A few times she spotted lakes that
looked like small mirrors reflecting the purple-blue sky.

It was a remarkably clear day, she thought, leaning as close as she
could to the window, which lightly fogged from the heat of her body. She
couldn't rest her forehead against the glass due to the presence of the
mask, but she got as close as she could anyway. She could see almost
directly below the flyer like that. Her eyes drifted along the ground,
and she wondered how often the weather was cloudy and grey, like it was
almost all the time at home. That reminded her of Captain Segard,
earnestly asking her to tell him about the rainfall. A corner of her
mouth lifted briefly. She still didn't know what to make of that.

She was starting to feel a little more comfortable and less like she was
breathing in a heady mixture of nitrous oxide along with regular air,
but her headache still lingered slightly. Jean wondered what she would
feel like tomorrow, and if she would know where she was when she woke
up.

She was in a light trance, her eyes automatically scanning the
vegetation while her mind was very much elsewhere, when Monique said, "I
know it doesn't look like it, but we're almost there."

The woman's low voice was abrupt and brought Jean straight back to the
present. She sat up, repressing the urge to rub her face - it wouldn't
work properly anyway - and muttered, mostly to herself, "Here goes
nothing." It was something she had said back when she was in concert
performances, when she was waiting in the wings in her best gown with
the rest of the orchestra, back before she had to figure out a way to
make money. It was a way to ward off the jitters, to tell herself that
she would bring whatever she had to the performance, even if what she
had wasn't much.

To her surprise, Monique snorted. "Yes, you're right. It is nothing.
We've been working all this time for absolutely nothing. Look at that.
It's only a few kilometres that way -" she pointed at the canopy - "you
can't even see the buildings. You can't even see the fields. They're
about the size of a thumbnail. You can walk across them in less than a
minute.

"But it's not like we haven't been working," she added sharply. Monique
leaned forward, her hands moving swiftly and roughly, bringing up the
control panel again and directing gestures to her book. "We work on it
all the time. I don't care what NiñaPinta says, it's not like we've all
been slacking down here. We're more desperate to make this work than
NiñaPinta is desperate to keep their profits. It's *our* lives on the
line." Those forbidding eyebrows were pulled down across her face.

"I'm sure you are doing all that you can," said Jean, discomfited. "I
didn't mean it the way you thought. I'm not trying to insult you."

"Yeah." Monique frowned even more fiercely. The flyer dropped rapidly,
and Jean gripped the armrests, her cane clattering as it fell to her
feet. "I know what they are saying up there. I'm sure you've heard all
of it."

"They haven't said anything," stuttered Jean, truthfully. The green was
getting very close. She could see a large patch of white stercrete, like
the landing pad, in front of them.

Monique didn't seem to be paying attention. Her gaze was now turned
fully on Jean, and her face was sparking with malice. "Next time you
talk to them, tell them that we're doing much better than could be
expected, given their support." The last word was dripping with irony.

She turned back to the controls in an icy silence, hands still moving
swiftly and angrily. Jean looked at her in amazement for a moment, and
then, not knowing what to say and suspecting that whatever she said
might make it worse, turned her attention outward again. She watched the
white square of stercrete come up to meet them, feeling like everything
was still going too quickly. It was too late now to tell Monique to turn
around.

The flyer slowed and gently lowered to a small landing platform. Out of
the front window, Jean could now see a corner of a large building and
another, smaller building, off to the left. Behind that, there was a
large field of white stercrete, and behind that, a looming wall of
blue-green vegetation. The thought of nothing but that expanse of
blue-green stretching to the horizon made Jean feel a little like she
had on the shuttle - but now she didn't have the jewel of Angharad to
comfort her, because she was actually here.

"I've got to store the flyer," said Monique. "Take your bag with you
when you get out. Someone'll be along in a minute to help you with it.
Probably our... leader."

Jean got out without another word, dragging her bag, cane, foot and arm
with her. The door of the flyer swiftly shut itself, and the flyer, with
a hum of its anti-gravity assisted engine, pulled away again. She
watched it as it lifted over the smaller building and dropped out of
sight on the other side.

"Jean, I presume?" came a voice from her right.

She turned to see a man come out from the large building, hand up in a
half wave. He was wearing a simple fabricated suit like Monique, but his
was a light blue and white, crisp and clean. When he got closer, the
same hand out to shake hers, she could see that he was tall and lean
with a healthy tan. His hair was naturally curly, and he had tried to
cut it short to look more professional. His hand was warm. "I'm Cannen,
acting director here at Angharad 2."

"Nice to meet you," she said.

He motioned to his book. "You'll excuse me, I'm just telling Monique
they need her at Field 17. I was hoping to speak to her before she flew
off but I was a bit too slow."

"She was in a hurry," said Jean, her own voice turning ironic. She
gripped her cane, her fingers wrapping around the curve of the hook on
the end, and tried not to slump.

Cannen blinked, then grinned cheerfully. "Oh, I see. Don't worry, I know
all about Monique." He turned away towards his book, which was an
unusual mirrored silver orb. It was bright in the sunlight, and mostly
the colour of the sky. It was so perfectly smooth that when it rotated
in place it was difficult to see the motion.

Her own book circled around her, scanning the area. She turned to do
this as well, squinting against the sunlight. The breeze pushed against
her, but it wasn't as strong here as it was at the landing pad. The
scent on the wind was more earthy here, like she was trudging through
bracken and leaf litter.

There was stercrete in all directions, but less of it than at the
landing pad. Perhaps only a hundred metres in every direction, past the
buildings. The buildings themselves were made of quick-poured concrete
fabrication, showing the hallmarks of machine manufacture. *Probably
poured before the settlers had even visited the planet,* she thought.
*That must have been strange, arriving on an empty planet with empty
buildings waiting for you.*

Cannen waved at his book and turned back to her. "That should sort her
out for a while," he said. "Now come along, let's check you in and go
see your room, quickly. We'll put your kit there and then you should
talk to biology."

There was a bit of confusion then - Jean had anticipated he'd take her
bag and waited for this, and he started to walk away, believing she'd
follow. Eventually he took her bag and indicated the way they were to
go. He slowed his steps to hers, but Jean had the impression she was
keeping him from something. She felt certain that he was used to briskly
racing around the settlement. It made her feel obliged to him, resentful
for feeling obliged, and therefore irritated. Jean was also reaching the
end of her stamina, which naturally made her short-tempered. She lagged
behind him no matter how she tried, and she could feel her breath coming
quickly.

Cannen headed to the building to the right, which had a small sign above
the door saying "To Lobby". Although the walls were plain concrete, set
firmly into the stercrete, the roofs were made of sloping thin metal
plates, crimped in between to channel the water away towards the
corners. They were shining in the sunlight, bright to the point of pain.
The one above the entrance extended outwards beyond the wall for at
least a metre, providing some cover for the door under the lobby sign,
but not enough to shelter under.

Cannen' book was holding the door for her. She paused to catch her
breath and waved at the roof. "What do you do when you hear a hortensia?
Surely that's not thick enough to protect anyone?"

He glanced up quickly, and then smiled at her. "We don't have many
hortensia out here, not like the landing zone. We don't worry about that
too much."

"Oh. I thought they were everywhere."

They went through the door into the cooler interior, Cannen following
her and then leading the way to the right. The lobby had a polished
concrete floor with a few simple metal and fabric chairs, a couple of
tables, and a welcome book for visitors, which was programmed to show an
ever changing variety of scenes from Angharad on the walls and floor of
the room.

"This is the waiting room," he said, unnecessarily. "This is where we
meet people who are temporarily stationed here. That door to the left" -
he motioned - "is where the office space is located. You\'ll have plenty
of space to work in the office, of course - all of these buildings were
built to house a lot more staff than we have on at the moment.

"The door across from the waiting room leads to the commons area. That's
where you'll find the automat and a recreational area, such as it is. We
have a games table and a games booth, both fully set up for use, however
we have a lot more space, so there's a lot of potential left in that
area. Let's go to the office now, we need to check you in."

His book unlocked the door for him. He waited on the other side for
Jean, who tiredly drug herself over the shiny concrete.

The office was enormous. It was clearly designed to be pleasant to work
in. Efforts had been made to fabricate large chairs, couches, and thick
rugs in a variety of pleasing colours and textures. There was a wide
fountain in the middle of the room, providing ambient noise, and there
were tall windows on all sides. Desks could be pulled up from the floor
or folded over the side of a couch or chair. A corner of the room was
reserved for a miniature canteen, and there were low tables to put the
drinks. A few people were seated at these tables, in quiet discussion
with their books projecting information around and in front of them.

Immediately inside the door and to the right was a small raised desk
with a palm and book reader. Jean pressed her hand against this when
Cannen indicated, and her book settled into the purpose-built cradle. It
took much longer for the system to check her book than it did to
register her biometrics, so she had time to ask, "Why are you acting
director? What has happened to the director?"

He smiled briefly, although it could have been a wince, and looked away.
"You must be aware that we have few staff at the moment. That's true of
every settlement in Angharad. We therefore have quite a few staff who
travel between settlements when needed. You'll find that most of the
biology team, for instance, are in Angharad One at the moment. The
remaining team member has actually been seconded to us from Angharad
Four. Similarly, our current director is now in Angharad Three and will
be for the foreseeable future, perhaps permanently. My normal post is
head of buildings management and admin, but since I am the most senior
administrative staff, I've been asked to act up as director."

Her book chimed and lifted from the cradle, which was now reading a
confirmation. Cannen nodded. "Your book can now interface with the
entirety of the Angharad network. Each settlement has a name for its
part of the network. We call ours Kovo. It responds to most questions.
Please let me know if you have any issues. Now, if you'd like to follow
me, the door to the quad is down and to the left, then we'll go across
to our living blocks."

Struggling with some of the rug textures with her cane, she looked
around at the bright sunlight streaming in through the windows into the
huge, sparsely populated room. "Where is everyone?"

"Oh, they're in the fields at the moment, mostly. Or the labs. The admin
team are usually the only ones in here. We'll introduce you to everyone
later. In the meantime, you can always check where people are. Kovo
keeps pretty good track of us." He paced ahead, and then waited for her,
eyes frequently lifting to his book.

Jean frowned - she didn't like trackers like that. They were easily
abused, usually a violation of privacy, and on Earth they were strictly
limited in use. She didn't remark on that, instead saying, "And how many
people are here at Angharad Two?"

"Sixty-three," he said promptly. She glanced at him and he chuckled.
"Head of admin, remember? I know everyone in the settlement very well.
It's my job to know who is here, what their needs are, their abilities,
and how they get along with each other. We have a personnel manager who
is my report, but we work pretty closely together."

"I suppose I report to you now," she said slowly. She could see into the
quad through the windows, which was a barren square of stercrete between
the concrete buildings. A short, roofed but open tunnel led from this
building into another, but she could see other open tunnels crossing the
quad as well. There were pots lining the tunnels, which seemed to have
been designed to hold plants but were filled with stercrete. With the
plants, the quad would have been a cool and vibrant place. It now only
reflected sunlight.

"Hmm," he said. "There is a bit of an issue with that. A teacher is part
of a much bigger system than what we have in place now, of course. You
would generally have a department head, and then a director of
education. You're not really in my scope... please, do the honours."

She nodded to her book and the door opened. They proceeded out into the
quad, where she half-closed her eyes from the glare from the stercrete.
The wind sprung up around her again, deliciously, and she felt herself
wishing that she could feel it in her hair. It was wonderfully fresh,
and the scent from the green, growing things was lovely.

"Nevertheless," Cannen continued, "you probably do need someone to
report to, and I'm kind of it by default. At the moment, you don't need
to take that formally."

"Right," she said, thinking she would have to consider that later, and
nodded to her book, who opened the next door at the end of the tunnel
under the sign "Living A". It would take a few iterations before her
book knew what doors she was likely to want to open without prompting.
It was learning the system like she was.

Inside the door of Living A was a short corridor with plain interior
panels and no decoration, lined with steel doors on both sides. "This is
the sanitation room," he said. "All settlers must complete the
sanitation programme every time they enter the building. It might be a
little inconvenient, but it's extremely necessary. It only takes a
minute. Your living unit has its own sanitation programme it will run
when you leave. You must only remove your mask within your own unit.

"These doors lead to changing booths. Once you enter, put your shipsuit
in the chute. You'll be provided with clean clothing. You'll have to
wait a moment for the programme to complete, and then you exit through
the far door. Don't turn around and leave the same way you went in, or
you'll have to go through the sanitisation programme again. Everyone's
done that at least once. If you're carrying anything it goes in this
box, see?" He showed her how it was done, sliding up a metal door that
was a bit smaller and lower than the other doors, and putting her bag on
the moving belt inside.

"What about my cane?" she asked.

He hesitated. "Can you do without it for a moment? Better safe than
sorry."

She placed her cane inside the metal door and looked up. Her
jewel-bright book was hovering a few feet above her head and twinkled
some lights at her. "And my book?"

"That can go into the booth with you."

She limped into a booth. It was lined with plain steel with barely
discernible seams at the corners, and only large enough to stand in. On
the wall was a plain metal square that she could push open to dispose of
her suit. It snapped shut afterwards, no doubt sealing itself tight. The
door had snapped in a similar way.

A sweet robotic voice - the type of voice mostly found in public
services and chosen for its least offensive character - told her to
stand still with legs and arms apart. That took some concentration and
her arm started trembling almost immediately. The lights flickered and
stuttered, and there was a whirl of air and a feeling of coldness. The
voice told her to lift her feet, one after another, which was extremely
difficult and she had to lean against the wall briefly. At the end of
it, she was even more exhausted, and found it difficult to put on the
fabricated clothing the booth dispensed for her. She had to sit on the
cold floor in order to put on the new boots. She cursed her useless hand
under her breath.

Cannen was waiting outside, still wearing blue and white. Jean's own
suit was tan and a bit too big. She wondered whether she could request
other colours and sizes.

He handed her the cane, and she gratefully transferred her weight to it.
She'd only had it for a short amount of time and she already relied on
it too much, she thought tiredly. "Is it much further?" she asked, and
immediately regretted saying such a weak thing.

"Not at all. We've put you in the first apartment as it's more
accessible. Just in here." He gestured to a steel door in front of them,
which had a blank nameplate. It was wider than normal. She hesitated,
then motioned to her book again. Cannen wouldn't have access to open the
door. In a moment it wooshed open silently.

Cannen preceded her, still holding her bag. "I'll just put this in the
bedroom," he said. The door snapped shut behind her, much like the door
to the changing booth.

Jean looked around. She hadn't realised she would have her own
apartment. The first room was large and open, with painted walls in a
light blue, dark grey carpet, fabricated wood furnishings, and a lovely,
well-appointed kitchen, albeit with clear signs of machine manufacture.
A window ran along the length of one wall, holding patterned glass that
obscured the view outside but let in light. There was even a generous
dining table.

"What do you think?" Cannen asked, coming out of the other room and
noticing her gazing around. "It can be a bit small for some. We've had
your apartment fitted out with rails and wide doors, just in case you
need that. We weren't sure what you required, so if you can think of
anything else you need, we'll put it on the fabrication list. We've got
so much biomass we can fabricate almost any type of furnishing. What we
can't change is the overall size of the accommodations. Someday that may
change, but we really can't justify it until we get more settlers."

"No - it's - it's very nice," she said. It was about four times the size
of her flat on Earth.

"Great," he said, and gestured to his book. "Let's put your name on the
door, then. You're in block A, which is in constant use at the moment.
We have four identical blocks, with four floors each, four units to a
floor. We have so many couples that we have quite a few units to spare.
I have thought about knocking together some units, but you never know
when we might need more space... if things go well." He cleared his
throat. "Anyway. Would you like to speak to biology now? They were keen
to speak with you."

Jean looked at him in exasperation. "No," she said, before she could
stop herself. "I need to sit down and rest." The nearest couch - in a
beautiful soft red - looked perfect.

His eyebrows went up, and then he reflexively looked at his book, and
then her window. He rubbed his chin and frowned at her. "They are
insistent that they speak with you now, before you sleep tonight. They
wanted to meet you at the landing pad, but that would have been a waste
of their time and is part of my department's responsibilities. We'll use
a chair. We've had one placed aside for your use - one moment."

"I don't want to use a chair," she said, aghast. "I don't need one."

"Just for now," he said. "They really do think it's urgent," and then he
turned and went out of her door.

Jean profaned softly and gripped the handle of her cane even more
tightly. She slowly, carefully, and angrily shuffled to the door. When
it opened, there was already a chair on the other side, with Cannen
standing waiting for her. It was cushioned in blue and hovered about a
hand's breadth off of the floor.

"I'm not using that," she said flatly. "I'll walk." *I'd walk through
hot coals first.*

He hesitated, and shrugged. "Okay, let's walk to the labs then. Whenever
you need the chair, it will be at your call. You can store it in your
room if you wish, but it does need to go in its cubbyhole periodically
for a recharge. It's convenient too, just a few metres down the hall.
You can see it from here - it's the green circles on the wall. Now let's
hurry before it gets too late."

"Too late?" she said, harassed. "Too late for what?"

Cannen paced ahead and turned left. Gritting her teeth, she walked as
quickly as she could after him. "This is the exit," he indicated the
metal door to the left, unnecessarily, as it was labelled in bright
green. "We've got to go through one by one. It's a bit like an airlock."

It was exactly like an airlock, with a rush of air each time the door
closed. The external door snapped shut behind her and they were once
again on the quad, on the same side as the internal door. "Is there only
one entrance and exit?" she asked.

"Only the one," he said briskly. "The labs are to the right. It's the
single storey building by the landing pad. You must have seen it when
you landed."

He started off again to the right, and after a short, huffed sigh, she
followed. To distract herself, she asked, "What do you do in
emergencies, then?"

Cannen had been gazing at his book, but glanced down at her. She thought
he looked stressed, or anxious - but she couldn't think of why. "Oh, in
emergencies, there are exits in each unit. These buildings were
constructed with all foreseeable natural disasters in mind. They are as
well protected as can be: earthquake proof, flood-proof, even avalanche
proof. The only thing we couldn't plan for were unique local disasters
that we may not have any idea about. Even so, Kovo can adapt for those."
He grimaced. "Except for the plants. If you see a plant trying to grow
anywhere on the building, immediately alert someone in my team. Or just
send out a general alert on the settlement channel. It's an issue that
needs to be taken care of urgently."

"A plant, growing?" Jean gaped up at him. "What else do I need to know?"

He once again looked up at the sky. "Let's hope the biology team fills
you in. We'll try to give you a proper orientation tomorrow, will that
be alright? Now, through here."

He let her unlock the door under the sign "Labs A". It was set in
another plain poured concrete building. Inside was more polished
concrete everywhere she looked, even the walls. The doors were all
airtight metal plates that opened by drawing themselves into the walls.
The air was cold.

"We don't try to keep this building sterile," Cannen explained. "Some of
the labs are, of course. To the right, here."

It was a couple of minutes' walk down the corridor, and she noticed that
there were at least two branching corridors. "There must be dozens of
labs in here," she said.

"There are," he agreed, shortly. "Okay, here we are." He waved at his
book. "She knows we're coming, so it should only be a moment. Then I'm
afraid I have to leave you."

It was only a few seconds before the door opened, and a woman walked
into the corridor. She was a tall woman with an open face, gorgeous long
brown hair, and a long, thin nose. She was wearing a full body shield
over her plain fabricated clothing. "Hello Cannen. You must be Jean. I'm
Mariana. Thank you for coming." She had a throaty, medium pitched voice.

"See you tomorrow, Jean. Mariana," Cannen said with a sharp nod, and
paced off down the hall, his long legs in an almost-lope.

Mariana frowned after him, and then smiled at Jean. "Come on into the
lab," she said, pleasantly. "Don't worry, you should only be in here for
a short amount of time, so you won't need a full shield. Your mask
should be enough. I'm only wearing this because I'm in here all the
time, and you never know..."

The lab was littered with boxes on tables and shelves, each labelled
clearly with electronic tags. A special cart made for the boxes sat next
to a machine that appeared to Jean to be a scanner. The bookplate held a
few books that were larger than normal and probably had specific
functions. It was a cluttered space, even though it contained nothing
but boxes, machines, books and Mariana.

Mariana gestured Jean to a small hard chair, and also dragged another
one from across the room so they could sit closely together. Jean sank
into it slowly but with gratitude, and leaned her cane on her knee. She
wasn't certain that she could get back up.

"I'm afraid it's only me today," Mariana said, folding her hands
together. She was rather birdlike with her long, thin fingers and
precise movements. "I'm not usually the person who inducts new settlers,
but Angharad One seems to have had a breakthrough and needed some
additional support. They're all off doing that and have been for a few
weeks now. I'm the only one here."

"What breakthrough?" asked Jean, shifting her weight a bit. The muscles
in her left leg were starting to twitch slightly.

"One of the new crossbreeds seems to be a bit resistant to the local
plantlife incursions," said Mariana, tipping her head to the side, her
long hair flowing over her shoulder. "If it is true, it would be a
hopeful development. Still a way to go, of course. It would only be one
variety of one species. We can't have a monocrop, we wouldn't be able to
survive on that. I'd tell you more but I'm not an agronomist - oh,
sorry, I mean a crop scientist - so I can't tell you the details. I'm
more of a pure botanist. A classic biologist, you might say. Everyone
who has gone to Angharad One is an agronomist. Agronomists are important
at the moment. Vital." Mariana sucked in her cheeks and tapped her
fingers against her lips, which she could easily do under the full body
shield. "Botanists are still vital of course, at least I think so. But
of course I would say that. You're a musician, yes?"

"Yes," said Jean, warily. "And a teacher."

"So the music they're hearing is doubtless why you're here."

Jean relaxed slightly. "I think that's the main reason, yes." She would
have added, *But that's impossible,* but Jean didn't know if Mariana had
heard it as well and didn't want to offend.

She needn't have worried. "Of course the plants aren't actually making
music," Mariana said forthrightly. "I don't know what our surveyors are
hearing, but it's not that."

"That's my opinion too," Jean said slowly. "But they must be hearing
something."

Mariana shrugged, looking away towards the sample boxes. "The plants
here just don't have the structures necessary to make anything that
sounds like music. Maybe with some of the compressive biological
structures, but they're generally pretty recognisable when they
propagate. Almost like a gunshot."

"You mean the hortensias," said Jean, translating this.

Mariana laughed lightly. "Oh, you've heard of those. Yes, aren't they
extraordinary? They're not the only type of plant with that ability,
just the one we run into the most often. I mean, if you actually believe
the plants here have a 'type', like organisms on Earth." She frowned.
"Oh, but I'm getting ahead of myself. I need to be orienting you."

Jean's eyebrows lifted and she almost laughed as well. "I thought it was
very important that I speak to you immediately. Are you only orienting
me? Nothing more important?"

"The orienting is important," Mariana returned, reprovingly. "Almost the
most important thing. So the main reason I wanted to speak with you
was - have you heard about the pollen?"

Jean shifted in her chair and smiled weakly. "That's why I'm wearing a
mask."

Mariana nodded shortly. "That's what I thought. That's what they tell
people, but they don't understand what's actually happening, despite my
reports." She shook her head and stood up, muttering under her breath
and pulling back her sleeve. Jean noticed with astonishment that Mariana
was wearing a booklet wrapped around her wrist and halfway up her arm.
Booklets were what books had been before they were fully autonomous
units. It began to project light against one of the walls and the floor,
and Mariana pushed a machine out of the way to create a little more free
space.

"I'm actually glad the rest of the team isn't here today because they
usually take over at this point," she continued. "Let's see a typical
Earth plant." Mariana pointed at the floor, and a pool of light
collected there. In an eyeblink a plant stretched up from it, putting
forth leaves and trembling as it became taller and taller. "This is a
tomato plant," she said approvingly, as tiny yellow flowers became
evident, then swelled into full round green fruit that turned a
brilliant red. "Okay, we can stop there."

The light shining from the plant lit her face as she bent over to
identify its different parts. "First we have the leaves, very delicate
in tomato plants, radiating from a central stalk. These sprout from
places that we call the nodes of the plant. Then we have an epidermis,
which is the skin of the plant, and then a vascular structure underneath
which moves things like water through the plant. And here we have the
tomatoes themselves - the fruit. The fruit holds the seeds."

She pointed at one of the tomatoes from the plant. "Let's see one a
little bigger."

Her booklet projected a seed above the tomato plant, but enlarged to
about the size of a platter. "Seeds are amazing," said Mariana. "Inside
each one is the entire plant. You have a root and leaves all folded
together within the seed coat. When exposed to the right conditions, the
roots will breach the seed coat and anchor themselves in the soil. The
tiny embryonic leaves will then reach up towards the sun." As she spoke,
the tomato plant vanished and the seed lowered into the soil, growing
upright and bearing fruit, which became a seed which grew again.

"This is sexual reproduction, of course," Mariana said. "The pollen is
produced by the male part of the plant and is spread to the female part
by any number of means. Some plants like this tomato plant can even
fertilise themselves. The pollen travels to the ovary and then you have
the bearing of fruit. The seeds then get dispersed by animals, as they
eat the fruit and then - uh - deposit the seeds elsewhere."

Jean, still amazed by the booklet, said distractedly, "But there are no
animals on Angharad."

"Correct. And, as far as I can tell, no seeds either."

Mariana touched her booklet delicately, and the tomato plant was
replaced with a different plant. "Here you have a random Angharad plant.
And a cross section - you can see there's something like the epidermis,
and something like a vascular structure, but it's variable, not neat and
tidy like Earth plants. The nodes seem not to be identifiable, even
though there are leaves. There's just nothing like a nodal structure in
place. There can even be different types of leaves on one plant. A plant
can be heavy on one side, and bend over entirely, like this one does."

At about a metre and a half in height, the plant had a thin stalk that
gracefully bowed in the middle. The bowing end of the plant exploded
with purple leaves, all layered on each other in a way that reminded
Jean of a pinecone or a pineapple. Some of the leaves were longer than
others, dark purple, and brushed the ground like soft trailing feathers.
It was clear that the weight of these had caused the bending of the
plant.

"They don't seem to have any identifiable replicating structure. They do
reproduce," said Mariana, "somehow. We're trying to figure that out.
Well, I am, anyway, and the botanists back on Earth. I'll receive my
correspondence with my Earth colleagues tomorrow. Did you know we get a
data packet every week? Something to look forward to." She looked down
and touched her wrist again, and the projection ceased. "The agronomists
are too busy trying to keep us alive to worry about AB-DNA too much. But
they need to know how the plants here work in order to do that, so I
feel like I'm contributing at least.

"Why do you have a booklet?" Jean asked, despite her best efforts not
to.

"My parents were Purists," Mariana said briefly, without obvious ill
will. "I don't have implants either."

Jean opened her mouth but couldn't think of anything to say. "Purist"
was a mildly derogatory term for a short-lived social movement that
rejected all bodily interventions about fifty years before. They did not
allow for implants, genetic alteration, rejuvenation or medical
interventions. Many of them had died from easily treatable conditions,
which had led to the short-lived popularity of the movement. She hadn't
realised there were still people who believed in that nonsense.

Mariana shook her sleeve back over her booklet. "The pollen they tell
you about on Angharad isn't pollen, because Angharad plants don't
reproduce in the normal sexual way that they do at home. It doesn't look
like pollen, either, which has a well known structure. What's in the air
is something else, some kind of genetic information that helps them
reproduce, but we haven't reached a consensus about that. I've been
calling it 'AB-DNA', for Alnair B DNA, of course. But it's not DNA. Not
like we know it.

"The stuff in the air looks more like a cross between bacteria and a
virus than pollen. It's bigger and more sophisticated than a virus, but
not really like a bacteria. Unfortunately that's the best way to
describe it at the moment. What we do know is that it is extremely
sticky, in a way that has to do with tiny structures on the envelope
that contains the genetic information. The envelope - unlike an Earth
plant's cell wall - is flexible, like an amoeba. It's flexible, with
little hooks, and gets everywhere. We've given it a scientific name, but
we're calling it pollen informally for now."

Mariana snapped her fingers and one of the lab books detached from the
wall. "Let's see a diagram of the most recent pollen scan. About there."
She smiled at Jean as the projection began to take shape. "My booklet
does almost everything, but there are some things that books do better."

"Why don't you get a book, then?" Jean asked. Her own book had retired
to the bookplate, where it passively observed everything.

"People always want to know," said Mariana absently. "I might get one
eventually, but I'm hesitant about the implants. I have a little phobia
about needles and my eyes. Cultural programming I think. Eventually I'll
get over it. It doesn't matter now, since I'm always using the lab
books."

She pointed at the hologram, which was labelled and coloured brightly.
The quality of the projection was many times better than the booklet,
and it was possible to see incredible detail. "Do you see the outer
envelope? Do you see the tiny hairlike things? They're hard to see even
at this magnification. We thought it might be cilia, but it doesn't act
like it. AB-DNA uses these to hook itself to almost any surface - at the
molecular level. Okay, that's enough." The projection ceased and the lab
book returned to the bookplate.

Mariana waved at the boxes scattered around the lab, her fine wrist
bones like the sweep of a wing. "I'm fairly sure it's how the plants
propagate. I've had hundreds of my colleagues back home review this and
they've been very helpful to be sure, but everything they tell me is
speculation. We've had amazing arguments on whether or not this pollen
is alive, for example. I'm not allowed to send samples back home, so I
am limited to my equipment and the time I can devote to putting on
experiments." She tapped her finger against her lips again. "Someday
we'll get somewhere, I'm sure. It took a hundred years to understand
DNA, after all."

Mariana shrugged and turned back to Jean. "But you don't need to know
all that," she said, smiling brittlely. "Its stickiness is the most
important thing. The pollen will coat anything exposed in this
atmosphere within minutes."

Jean was beginning to understand. "So I need to run the sterilisation
programme any time I enter my building," she said.

"Oh, certainly that," Mariana said, her eyebrows going up. "But really
you should limit your time outside to only necessary excursions. Use
your mask at all times - AB-DNA can stick to the lining of your lungs.
Do not take any material inside with you, like interesting leaves or
branches. Don't touch the plants unless strictly necessary. If you have
to get close to them, use a machine to clear the way. Most people use
personal flyers for shorter trips so they don't have to walk through the
plants. If you're going to be super strict, you'll wear a full shield,
like me."

Jean frowned. "No one told me to do that."

Mariana made a graceful negating move with her hand. There was no book
to interpret this, which struck Jean as odd. "They can't. If they
required all personnel to wear a full shield, this planet would then be
classed as a hazardous contaminant and unfit for human settlement."

Jean stared. "Is it?"

Mariana started to say something and then hesitated. "We can't... we
can't say that."

Jean caught her breath. Nothing had gone right since she woke up in the
medbay on the *Hello and How Are You?*, no one had been straightforward
with her, everyone had been false. These people were hiding something.
If it had been one of her students, she would have had ways of dealing
with them, but she felt helpless now. She couldn't tell what would
happen if she demanded answers.

Mariana seemed helpful, honest, and concerned. So Jean skewered her with
a direct gaze and asked again, "*Is it?*"

Mariana had the grace to look ashamed and drop her eyes. "I hope not,"
she said after a pause, her throaty voice slightly hoarse. "But the
decision to declare it as a hazardous planet is getting closer. Unless
we come up with some way to understand what is going on here."

Jean made an incoherent sound, and accidentally nudged her cane over
with a clatter. Mariana watched her try to pick it up for a second, then
came to her aid. "I'm sorry," she said. "It is upsetting, I know, it
upsets me too. It's an unfortunate possibility. But we are working on
this all of the time and we might be able to figure out a way to stay
here. I probably shouldn't have said anything," she muttered. "This is
why I don't usually orient people."

Jean took the cane from her and put the tip on the floor bracingly. "Is
there anything else I should know?" she said, trying not to be
sarcastic. "That you can tell me?"

Mariana grimaced and looked away. "It's really better that you know this
now," she said. "No one else is likely to tell you. There are a lot of
things here that they don't want to talk about. This is the big one,
unfortunately. The good news is that if you limit your exposure to the
minimum and wear your mask at all times, you will probably not have any
side effects when living here."

Jean sat back. "Side effects?" she practically shouted.

Mariana made the negating gesture again. "Asthma, breathing problems in
general. That sort of thing."

"What do you mean, that sort of thing?" Jean snapped, exasperated. "It
can't just be asthma, Mariana. People on Earth get asthma all the time
from all sorts of things. We don't declare the place uninhabitable."

"We aren't sure yet," said Mariana shortly. "And that's really all I can
say. I wanted to talk to you to let you know how important it is. A lot
of people, after a few weeks here, can get... overly confident. They may
think that since the sky is clear and the air is fresh that there are no
hazards. Please do remember that we don't know what will happen to you
long term if you breathe in this pollen."

"How about just being coated with it? Does that do anything?"

Mariana sighed. "We don't think so. Our skin is pretty protective and
this pollen doesn't like it for some reason. The best thing to do is
decontaminate. Every time."

"Wonderful," said Jean.

Jean huffed her way back to her quarters over the sunlit stercrete of
the quad, stabbing her cane at the unyielding surface with every step.
Her head was a mess, full of things that would boil to the surface in
turn, each one causing her to grit her teeth and grip her cane a little
tighter. Her shadow, with its awkward shape, seemed to taunt her and she
could barely remember how amazing she had thought it earlier. Her book
followed almost apologetically after.

She couldn't go back to Earth, she thought, with a vicious stab that
jarred her hand. She couldn't face every single day without her father,
without her mother, without anyone who cared about her at all. She
didn't want to spend hours each day going over scales with ten year old
students who wanted to be there even less than she did. She didn't want
to return to the close and dirty confines of the city, to her closet of
a flat, to a weary drudgery that seemed to offer no hope and no future.

She would die here, she thought. That was it. So it didn't matter - she
stabbed the pavement - that she couldn't breathe the air, couldn't touch
the plants, couldn't eat anything but rations, couldn't do anything
helpful but be a nuisance and a - stab - disabled person. At least she
wasn't at home. This, as bad as it was, was better than that.

*What am I going to do about this?* she wondered. If she had spoken the
question aloud, it would have sounded desperate, almost unhinged.

There was no answer. When she had finally made it back to her apartment,
having gone through the decontamination process and all that entailed,
she stumbled to the red couch and sat, cradling her face in her hands.
It felt good to remove her mask. She breathed deeply and evenly for a
few minutes.

There was one thing she could do, she reminded herself.

After a good amount of time, Jean struggled to her feet and shuffled to
the kitchen. It contained much the same fare as the *Hello and How Are
You?* except for the addition of a small loaf of yellow bread and a
handful of fresh lettuce. The yellow bread smelled like corn when she
broke it open, and she happily breathed in the scent. There was nothing
like butter available for the bread, but she enjoyed the sweet, heavy
texture anyway. She wondered if it was a treat for her first day, or
whether she would get a fresh loaf in the morning.

A little refreshed, she slowly dragged herself to the bathing room and
washed her face and hands before returning to the red couch. She pushed
her hair behind her ears and straightened her clothing, then nodded to
her book.

It swiftly centred itself in front of her. "To Captain Segard," she
said, and it dipped slightly in acknowledgement.

"I'm here at Angharad Two," she said, and cleared her throat. "It didn't
rain today. I know you want to know that, so it's the first thing I want
to tell you.

"You also wanted to know if I'd seen anything strange." She hesitated.
Her book hung motionless in front of her, so still that the reflections
didn't change on its jewelled surface. She knew that it would remove any
silences from the transmission, so she took her time, turning over her
thoughts and trying to guess what the captain would want to know.

"I find it odd," she said slowly, "that this place is so deserted.
Everyone seems to be travelling to other settlements. There is only one
member of the biology team that is present at this settlement. The
director seems to have been transferred out, perhaps permanently. I saw
very few people. I wanted to ask, 'Where is everyone?' but I thought it
might be taken the wrong way, or maybe they wouldn't answer me. The
acting director said they were in the agricultural fields but I can't
imagine that they needed that many people out there.

"I'm going to go to the - I think he called it the automat - in the
morning and see if more people are here."

Jean bit her lip and thought for a few more seconds. It probably
wouldn't help at all to tell him what she was really thinking, which was
that the futility of their efforts here made her upset and angry, and
that she wished they hadn't woken her up until she was truly needed. He
probably already knew that, along with everything else that she'd found
out today.

"That's all," she told her book. "Save a copy as a personal journal."
Her book whirled in the air like a kaleidoscope.

Jean was exhausted in body and spirit, but she still spent some time
investigating the inside of her apartment, using her cane for balance.
The patterned window could be adjusted to show other patterns or
amazingly lifelike renderings of other landscapes. She asked her book to
change through these quickly, eventually settling on a rainforest scene,
complete with fat raindrops hitting the glass with a gentle patter.

She found that most of the furniture had extra functions for disabled
people, and she tried some of them out. The taller chairs could be used
as a wheelchair if necessary, and would dip to allow her to sit down
easily. The shorter ones would inflate and deflate autonomously to
provide support, and they sprouted handles in odd places if she needed
help to stand up. All of which she appreciated, if grudgingly.

If she got close to a wall, a hidden switch would activate and railings
would fold outward. This seemed ridiculous to her at first but she found
herself reaching to touch the railings embarrassingly often. The kitchen
also had railings, but more importantly, all surfaces were adjustable
and everything could be rearranged within easy reach with a word to her
book.

She made a heroic effort and managed to force herself to look closely at
the bathing room. It, also, was thoughtfully arranged for a disabled
person with handles and railings on all surfaces, fold down seats,
adjustable water spouts, and plenty of room. The bathing apparatus
looked especially inviting, but Jean couldn't imagine taking off her
clothes one more time.

Instead, she went to the bedroom and collapsed on its magnificent soft
bed, which was covered in pillows and real - real! - blankets, all in a
comforting cool grey. She reached across to snag a corner, rolling this
between her fingers wonderingly. Her book settled like a butterfly on an
ornate metal bookplate above the table beside the bed.

*I will stay here,* she thought. *I will do it.*

She fell asleep with the soft blanket folded under her chin.

She woke up to a clatter. It scared her so that she jumped up in bed,
turning to the right so she could lean on her good arm. Panting, she
blearily stared around the dark room. Her heart beat so quickly she
could feel it hitting the inside of her ribs. It took a few moments for
her confusion to clear enough that she knew where she was.

Nothing was different. She was still in the bedroom in her apartment in
Angharad. This realisation didn't fully quiet her - actually being on
Angharad was still unsettling - but it did calm her breathing somewhat.

*What was that?* she wondered. She pushed her hair from her forehead
with her weak hand, which shook a little. She knew she had heard
something. It hadn't been a dream.

Then she noticed the dark shape on the table beside the bed. There
hadn't been anything there when she went to sleep - had there? A little
frightened, she hesitantly reached with her weak hand to pick up the
object.

It was hard and round, and for a moment she couldn't understand what it
was. "Lights," she snapped, hoarsely.

Nothing happened.

This also, she couldn't comprehend for a moment. "Lights," she said
again, more clearly.

Nothing. She breathed a few breaths, thinking furiously. Eventually she
cried, "Kovo! Turn the lights on. Gradually." To her astonishment, all
of the light panels in her apartment began to emit a gentle glow. She
slowly turned her eyes back to what she held in her hand.

It was the dark and lifeless husk of her book.

Stunned, she could only gaze at it for a minute. It was her book.
Nothing else she had seen looked quite like it. All surfaces were a
different jewel, joined together as seamlessly as if it had been grown
as one huge multi-coloured gemstone. One of the surfaces was bigger and
flatter than the others, which was where it attached to bookplates. That
flat spot had been facing upward when she picked it up.

She used her weak hand to turn it over, and over again. The internal
spark was gone. She didn't know how that could be. "Kovo," she said -
because she had turned to electronic support all her life - "what is
wrong with my book?"

"It is rebooting," said an impersonal voice above her. Kovo's voice had
been carefully pitched right between the male and female timbre, and as
a consequence sounded entirely inhuman.

"What is that? What do you mean?" asked Jean, examining the surfaces of
her book with her unresponsive fingers as best she could. She knew that
she couldn't do anything but it felt wrong to see her book like this.
Did books - could books *die*?

"It will be back to its normal state shortly," said Kovo.

Somewhat comforted, Jean held her book in her hand like a broken bird,
waiting to see life return to its heart but horribly worried that it
wouldn't. And, reluctantly, she thought about her mother.

The gift had been an extravagant one. Her mother had always been an
extravagant person, especially for birthdays. Any excuse for a
celebration was also an excuse for a huge gift that caused the recipient
to feel awkward and uneasy, as if they owed her mother something. Jean
rather thought that had been the point. Her mother liked to know that
people owed her things...

She angled the book to see if the ambient light could penetrate the
surface any deeper. This particular book had been her biggest wish since
she was old enough to appreciate beauty. Perhaps it was juvenile to love
bright things, but she had always loved the way it glowed like a
coloured fire, like a manifestation of all the gorgeous things in the
world.

Over the years it had become part of her in a way that she couldn't
express. Her fingers fumbled at its dark surfaces and she had to sniff
to keep tears back.

Jean knew that her father hadn't approved of the gift. It was too much
for her, like gifting her with a flyer or a trike before she could walk.
But he couldn't take it away from his grateful daughter, so he had
turned away from the table that was bedecked with birthday things and
withdrew to his private offices. Jean still remembered the smile her
mother had on her face when he had left the room, even though Jean
herself had been crestfallen to the point where she considered telling
her mother she didn't want the book.

Something fluttered in the book, and she sat bolt upright. It continued
to flutter and she held the book up to her eyes, staring into its heart
intently. There was a light inside but it was dim and uncertain,
guttering like a candle at the end of its wick.

Kovo's cold voice said, unprompted, "The process will go more quickly if
you place the book on the bookplate."

She hastened to do so, scooting across the blankets with her left hand
cupping the book against her side. With all her weight on her right
foot, and bracing with her right hand on the table, she reached as high
as she could to put the book on the bookplate. She held it there for a
few seconds, hand trembling, worried that it would fall if she let go
too quickly.

In the end it stayed, clinging to the bookplate, the light still
flickering in an unpleasant way. She sat down and watched it until her
neck began to ache. Then she lay down, asked Kovo to turn off the
lights, and had an uneasy sleep until the morning.

The next morning, as usual, the lights in her room brightened when she
opened her eyes. She lay blinking at the ceiling until remembering what
had happened to her book. She sat up quickly and looked at it.

It appeared as it usually did - a bright, illuminated jewel. Jean stared
at it for a moment, then sighed.

She cast her eyes around the room, noting the clothes dispenser and the
recycler. Then she noticed, beside the open bedroom door, the kit bag
that had been hauled from the shuttle. She stretched the best she
could - unresponsive arm and leg taking a bit more effort - and took the
few steps to haul the kit bag on top of the bed.

It was heavier than she expected and for a moment she couldn't remember
what was in it. She found the sealed opening and drew a finger along it
to open it.

On top amidst the jumble was a small hologram square. She put this on
the otherwise empty table next to her bed, where it silently began to
project images of her family, old friends, and old performances. Next to
it she placed the chunky diamond and sapphire statue that was her award
for winning the Hadfield Championship twenty-five years before. It was a
heavy thing but she wouldn't be parted from it.

There was a set of perfume from her mother. The slight waft of scent
when she lifted it from the bag and set it on the table so strongly
reminded her of home that Jean had to shake her head and clear her
throat. There was also a box full of jewellery that her father, in the
main, had given her. He had also bought her the onyx and quartz
jewellery box. She put that beside the perfume.

Then she was finally able to pull out the oblong instrument case. This
she put on her bed.

Underneath it were some silk scarves and other small items that had been
gifted to her over the years that she hadn't discarded. She left those
in the bag, and shoved it under the bed. She sat beside the instrument
case, thinking about nothing for a few minutes. Then, because she
couldn't help herself, she opened it.

Inside was a small but perfect sixteen string kantele, whole and
unbroken. It was made from warm and beautiful natural carved wood, just
a little shorter than her arm, and the strings were fanned out across
the board in a pleasing manner. She lifted this out of the case and put
it on her lap, then automatically reached for the tuning key.

Her book left its plate and hung nearby as, hissing with frustration,
she used her left hand to hold the key and turn the pegs while her right
hand plucked the strings. The key kept slipping and she sometimes had to
hold her left hand with her right to steady it. When it was reasonably
tuned, she ran her right hand over it, using her fingertips for a
glissando, then started a simple series of scales.

It felt nice to hear the clear liquid sound of it. It filled her silent
bedroom and echoed off the bare walls. She let her weak hand relax to
support the kantele, and played the right hand of an old folk song she
vaguely remembered, improvising where she was unsure. At the end of it,
she found she was smiling.

Jean gently placed the kantele on the bed.

She visited the bathing room. There was another disposal chute for her
current clothes and the gel bandages, which peeled off easily. She chose
a light scent for her bath, and revelled in the sheer amount of space
she had to get thoroughly clean. The supports and handholds were
comfortable and felt secure. The ship had not boasted nice facilities,
and her old flat had been nearly as miserly. She took the time to use
the styling machine, and at the end of its cycle, her shoulder length
brown hair was nicely wavy and neatly put in place.

Back in the bedroom, she negotiated with the clothes dispenser, using
her book as an intermediary, for a black suit with a long purple top
which was cinched in with a simple black tie around her waist. With
three thin gold bracelets, six gold earrings, and one silk scarf, she
almost felt human again, more like Jean Harrell and less like a medical
patient. She clicked the thin metal chain of her mask around her neck,
settled it under her scarf, and walked out of her apartment with
equanimity.

That brief spell of confidence lasted until she exited the airlock back
into the stercrete quad. Gasping, she gaped upwards. Her book left her
side and investigated the quad as she stared, cane forgotten in her
hand, overawed.

The buildings were dark shapes against the glorious sky, which
coruscated with green and purple curtains of colour over the deepest,
most velvety of blacks. Stars like spilled diamonds glinted between the
streamers of the aurora. Two tiny moons hung in the sky like flicked
drops of paint, one a pure white, the other a dull orange flecked with
red. The arc of the galaxy stretched behind everything.

One star was brighter than all the rest. It blazed in the sky, almost
unwavering, and as bright as the moons. It burned with a pure blue
light, and hung from the galaxy like a pendant.

Jean drank this in for a moment. The simulated environment of the
sensory chamber could never compare to this. It could never reproduce
the brilliance and the experience of sensing photons arriving from
thousands of light years away.

The streamers of aurora, sometimes brightening to a light rose, rippled
above her in a way that made her feel like they were chiming like bells.
In her mind, each star was a clear sharp note from a glass harp, and the
moons were the mournful throb of a bass flute. The galaxy itself was the
string section, a harmony of brilliance that went on, and on, and on.

Her neck ached, and she found, looking around, that she could see one of
the stercrete-filled plant pots. She hitched her way there, taking care
with the uneven ground, and then settled herself on the cold rock.

Some time later, her book came back to her silently. Without dropping
her gaze from the heavens, she said, "Where is our star? Where is Sol?"

"You can't see it from here," said her book, conversationally.

She slowly brought her thoughts back from the wonder above, and stared
at her book, a tiny shining speck beside her. "What?"

"Oh!" a voice exclaimed from the darkness. "Oh, someone else is out
here. I'm sorry, I didn't hear you come out."

Thoroughly confused, Jean looked around to see a dark figure walking
towards her over the quad. "I'm afraid I didn't see you either," she
said hastily, making an effort to stand. "I, ah, was going toward the
automat, but I didn't realise it was still dark." She tried to make out
details of the figure, but couldn't see anything but the outline of its
head. "I didn't, well, this is a bit... overwhelming."

She waved towards the sky with her weak left arm, which probably
couldn't be seen well in the darkness. The figure chuckled. "Yes, it is
impressive, isn't it? There are few spots on Earth where you can see
anything like this. Our colony here has decided to limit external
lighting when at all possible for many reasons - with my encouragement
of course. We haven't met. You're Jean, yes? I'm Aren." She could tell
he was male by his soft, light voice, and she could see him tip up his
face to look at the sky. "I sometimes come out quite early, when I'm
having trouble sleeping. It's the time difference, you see - some people
take a long time to get used to it. I am unfortunately one of them."

She searched around for something to say. The wind had died down and the
quad was silent, which made every pause seem like an eternity. "Do a lot
of people get up quite early then?"

"No," he sighed. "I believe I accidentally trained myself to do that by
coming out here as soon as I was awake! No matter. I'm quite sure you
will adapt better than that. The best thing you can do, of course, is
hug your pillow and get a little more shut-eye. Most people enjoy nine
hours of sleep."

"But you enjoy this more," she guessed.

Aren chuckled, quietly. "Caught out! Yes. It is quite something, isn't
it? Especially Alnair Gruis, which you can see brightly shining there.
We get auroras regularly, even as far south as we are. Alnair B is very
energetic and throws off a lot of solar flares and ejections. We only
have a few minutes of useful darkness left, however, so enjoy it while
you can. The sun comes up as quick as you like - much quicker than where
I am from. In about fifteen minutes you will not be able to see any of
it at all. Look, it is already getting lighter over in the east."

Indeed, it was; a soft haze was starting to spread upward, and it
blotted out some of the stars. The aurora had begun to wash out, losing
much of its distinction close to the horizon.

"It's so strange," Jean said. "I wasn't prepared for the colour of the
sky here on Angharad. It doesn't look like that in vids."

"You mean the purple tint," Aren confirmed, sounding amused. "I think
you'll find if you watch the same recordings again, they will look
different to you, now that you know what it should look like." He then
turned and gestured. It hadn't been long - a few minutes at most - but
she could see him much better. "Shall we have breakfast? I believe you
said something about the automat."

Once inside, the automat was dazzlingly bright compared to the pre-dawn
Angharad. Its hard lighting gave Jean a feeling of unreality.

Circular tables were scattered around a polished concrete floor, and on
one wall were the dispenser units. The wide windows were blacked out,
which gave the room a closed in and ugly feeling. A few people were
seated at the tables, and they looked up as Jean entered, Aren having
let her proceed through the door before him. "Good morning," she said,
uncertainly.

They echoed her greeting. To her surprise, they all stood up and
approached her, shuffling around the yellow-topped tables and extending
hands toward her.

"You're Jean, of course," said the first person, a woman a little
shorter than Jean. "I'm Hesta. I am on the survey team." Hesta was
beautiful, with a wide mouth, soft and dark watchful eyes, and a
delicate slim frame. When she shook Jean's hand, Jean noticed that
Hesta's bracelet collection was far more impressive than Jean's own,
being made of knotted gold and rubies where Jean's were slim gold bands.

"You all seem to know me," said Jean, taken aback. Hesta was the woman
in the second sound recording she had tried to analyse on the *Hello and
How are You?*, and Jean was once again struck by how different one's
appearance could be from the sound of one's voice.

"We rarely get new colonists," Hesta said. "Everyone is always
interested in who is joining us."

"Jean, I'm Dale, water supply and coordination," said another woman, who
had a broad and freckled face. "I mostly work with water treatment but I
also do some irrigation work with Monique, who you've met." Her hand was
warm and her expression friendly.

"Oh yes, Monique," Jean said darkly, which made the other people smile.

The next person was a man of middle height and short, wayward dark hair.
"I'm Gaudel. Pleased to meet you. Soil and farming." His voice was
pleasant, a light tenor. He had a soft accent but Jean couldn't place
it.

"Nathan. Systems engineering and compliance." This man was thin, with
sandy blonde hair and an apologetic look. "I used to have a far more
impressive title, but we've all just tried to get along and do the job
down here."

"And I see you've met our resident genius celebrity, Aren Taymon," Hesta
said, in her businesslike alto voice.

"I'm only a natural philosopher, Hesta, although I am flattered," Aren
said, dryly. "And yes, I was just speaking with Jean here about our
beautiful night sky." He smiled down at Jean. "It is nice to meet you."

Jean nodded and tried not to stare. Aren's hair was chestnut, but it was
tipped with grey. He had fine lines on his forehead, lines around his
eyes, and lines around his mouth. His face was slightly gaunt. It
surprised and shocked her - it had been many years since she had seen
anyone who showed age on their face. After a frozen moment, she turned
to the others.

"Are - are you also all early risers?" she asked, after much effort.

"In truth, I am at the end of my shift," said Gaudel. "We try to have
all-hours coverage of the settlement, so that someone is available to
respond to any alarms. Usually this is a member of my team, but we
occasionally ask for volunteers to cover a shift or two." He smiled,
charmingly.

Dale laughed, but it turned into a cough. "You mean the involunteers,"
she said, and cleared her throat. "Everyone does a little bit of
everything around here," she said to Jean. "We have to, you know... I
did a shift in the fields last week."

"It is important that we cover any contingency," Gaudel started to say,
a crease furrowing his brow, but Dale laughed again. "Oh, don't worry,"
she said. "We all know how it is. I just wish we had more people to
spread out the work."

"How many people are here, exactly?" asked Jean, taking advantage of
that clear opening.

The others looked down, or away. Aren was the only person to respond.
With the ghost of a smile, he said, "That depends on what you mean by
'here'. On the official logs, I believe we have almost two hundred
people."

Jean hesitated. "Cannen said you had about sixty people?"

Aren shrugged. "Two hundred... sixty... twenty. The number fluctuates
from day to day, and is usually less than the day before."

"A lot of people are out in the field," Hesta said, frowning and tipping
her head to the side. "People come and go all the time. It's a big world
and we all have things to do."

Dale put up a hand. "Hang on, hang on, Jean hasn't even had her
breakfast yet. Jean, why don't you grab something, and come sit with
us."

Jane hesitated but went to the food dispensers, where she found a much
wider variety of food than was available in her own kitchen. In one
stasis box were plates of some sort of cold custard with slices of
papaya, and in another, to her shocked wonder, were fresh hot bread
rolls. She wavered over a box that held sausages, but eventually
selected one. A spout held hot coffee and she filled a mug.

She had overloaded her tray with this largess, having subsisted on
reconstituted milk and mixed grains for weeks, and looked at it in
dismay, having no idea how she was going to get it to the table. Dale
noticed this and hurried over to help, but Aren picked up Jean's tray
with one longfingered hand and took both her tray and his own back to
the tables. She slowly followed, cursing internally. What an impression
she had made, not even being able to carry her own food.

There was a bit of scraping of chairs as the others made room for them
at the table. They managed to fit everyone more or less on the same
table, Nathan and Dale having cleared off the used cutlery. Jean felt
very self-conscious in front of all of these strangers, but followed
Aren's lead of eating the delicious hot roll first.

"I thought you were having trouble just growing corn," she said, pulling
a strip of the crust off and nibbling it. "I didn't know you could grow
wheat."

They all laughed, and she looked up, startled. "The ship food is so
terrible," Dale said lightly, and they all laughed again. Jean's
eyebrows raised and she looked around at them all.

"So I hear you are a music teacher," said Gaudel. Jean noticed his
accent again, which was softly sweet. "What do you play?"

Jean paused for a second, then mentally shrugged. "The harp is my main
instrument, but I do play other things," she said, returning to
deconstructing her bread. "I can - could - also play the flute, but not
nearly as well. And I teach many things, mostly the harp, as you would
suspect, but flute, and also a bit of piano. I teach music theory - that
is my main subject."

"Do you teach the guitar?" asked Dale, eagerly.

"I have taught the guitar," Jean said, slowly.

"Excellent," said Dale, grinning. "You can teach me. I'm terrible, but
I've always wanted to get better."

"I've always wanted to learn the violin," said Nathan, putting emphasis
on the first word. The other people at the table groaned, and he said,
"What?"

"You're going to have a lot of students, Jean," Aren said, chuckling.
"We are somewhat lacking in entertainment."

She noticed that when he talked, the others

She met him in the early morning again. Aren Taymon was sitting in the
mess with a cup of coffee and smiled kindly at her. He tapped the seat
across from him and asked her to join him.

"I've never met a famous person before," Jean said.

"I used to like it," Aren said. "At first, anyway. It was very exciting,
what me and Michael came up with. To tell you the truth, it was mostly
Michael. It was all theoretical, you know, at the time. People were
actually coming up with a lot of these solutions to travel faster than
light - ours was just one of many. It was very science fiction, and any
new theory caused a lot of fantastical interest. Of course you really
can't travel faster than light, but without travelling fast, we were
never going to get anywhere, so any grain of hope that it could be
accomplished created quite a stir.

"He had the original idea. A massive object moving quickly through space
does distort or warp the space in front of it *and* behind it. We can
see it in nature, in quickly moving galaxies or rotating black holes.
But we needed a way to make it work on a real basis.

"So he came up with what he called his ski lift theory. That's what we
called it, at first. Imagine large numbers of people travelling slowly
on a ski lift, and when they get up at the top of the mountain, they one
by one travel quickly back. Imagine that the ski lift was packed with
thousands of people, and it was very slow, and the people coming back
were skiing at very high speeds. They wanted to keep skiing so they
rejoined the ski lift. And imagine that the rules of the slope stipulate
that there could only be a certain number of people skiing down the
mountain, but so many people wanted to ski that day that the lift was
getting very full, and so the people skiing down had to go faster, and
faster, just to cycle everyone through. And more and more people joined
the ski lift every moment.

"When the skiers went faster and faster, they started dragging space
with them, piling it up in front of them, and behind them they made a
distortion that wasn't a vacuum, but was a tension through space. Then
imagine there were hundreds of thousands of ski lifts just like that
one, right next to each other and all around each other, so that the
tension in space became quite large.

"Then imagine the ski lift stopped moving, fairly abruptly, and the
skiers stopped skiing. That tension had to go somewhere, and it sprang
back with quite a snap. Faster than light.

"Well, imagine we had positioned a spaceship at the top of the
conglomerations of ski lifts. It would be carried along with the space
as fast as the space itself moved. And that was our theory.

"It was theoretical at first. We wrote a paper, and of course Mike's
name was first but since I did most of the maths I was second. We saw it
as the movement of massive particles in a partially closed system - the
return system had to be closed of course, but we needed to add more
energy into the outgoing system to spin it up to relativistic speeds -
and I used a model drafted on hydrogen atoms.

"As I say, it caused quite a stir." He lifted his coffee cup with a
faraway look. "Most models at that time used exotic matter and I wasn't
asking for anything like that. Everyone wanted to talk to us about it,
everyone in our country and all over the globe. We thought it was great
fun and spent a long time just speaking about the theory. We were both
young men, impressionable and excited by possibilities. And I would
always use the analogy -" and here he put the cup on the table and
tapped it gently with the tips of his fingers, "fatefully as it turned
out - that we were winding back space like a slingshot, with a spaceship
loaded inside."

He turned it moodily, using its handle and one finger. "Slingdrives,
slingspace; and it wasn't even really my theory but since I named it, I
was usually credited with it in the press. Mike was very good about it,
but I could tell that it bothered him a little. Still, we remained fast
friends, and I made sure he got his equal time speaking.

"As I said, it was theoretical, but a few years later we were invited by
other groups to work in partnership and make a real model to test the
ski lift theory. Amidst this, the rejuvenation drugs started to come
out. As I was nearing retirement age but still wanted to work on the
project, I started taking them too."

He went quiet, and Jean wanted to say something but thought it was best
to wait to see whether he continued. There was no noise that she could
hear but the wind.

Eventually he smiled painfully at her, as if she was emanating a
particularly bright light. "Mike died, of course. The rejuvenation drugs
didn't work well for everyone. I was lucky. He was not. He knew the
risks, of course, but when the risks happen to you it's still not
pleasant, is it, Jean?"

He took her silence as a response, and nodded. "Things look so different
in hindsight. Mike was getting older, a few years older than me, and
rejuvenation treatments didn't work perfectly for people who were past a
certain age. We were seeing real progress in what we were doing - actual
results, measurable, positive results, that showed the tension in space.
He felt it was worth the risk of the treatments to continue working on
it, and then suddenly Mike was gone. But I was now once again a healthy
younger man, what could I do but continue?

"It was forty more years, after Mike left, before we had a real working
model that was scalable, reliable, and as efficient as our little group
could make it. We had been living off grants and government funding
during this time... Thinking about it is strange. It seemed like such a
huge secret, the details of what we were doing, and we tried to keep it
as close to us as possible. I felt like a double agent just living my
daily life when my heart and attention were caught up in this huge
thing.

"Then we went public with it, and suddenly there were a lot of lawyers,
and new companies, and profit structures and royalties, and more public
speaking, so much more of that! Everyone wanted my thoughts, and I was
all alone in front of the world speaking about the slingdrive. It was my
face associated with it, so I was to blame or to laud for all its faults
and promises.

"I finally managed to wiggle my way back into the actual work after a
while. I helped adapt the drive for interplanetary travel. I helped turn
it into the TTG."

He drummed his fingers on the table and looked at the ceiling. "I really
don't want to overstate my part in this really. When I say I helped,
that's what I did. By the time the TTG was hanging out there in space,
that paper I wrote with Mike was so far away that it was a single note
in a symphony, to use your language. But it was the first note. And if
it had never been played, the rest of the symphony wouldn't have
happened."

He smiled again, a little sadly. "That's the short form of the story. An
even shorter form is that my dream came true, everything I had been so
excited about was here in front of me. Over this time I was still taking
the rejuvenation treatments, and it really was nice to keep my youth and
vigor for the work. I had definitely seen a difference mentally once I
started taking them. People underestimate the value of a younger brain.
They say with age comes wisdom, but with youth comes creativity,
interest, and fresh passion. You wouldn't know the difference, of
course, having never grown old.

"But then I thought, it's done. I am done. And for the past thirty years
I stopped getting the rejuvenation treatments. It took some time for the
aging process to reassert itself; the new treatments are very potent
indeed.

"And during that time," he said, fixing his intent gaze on her, "I
became a natural philosopher, of course. I stopped working on the
slingdrive - effectively retiring - and turned my waning interest on the
natural world and how we relate to it. There is more to that of course,
but I believe I've spoken enough already. When I came here, I and
everyone else felt that it was a neat bookend to my life. I'd created
the slingdrive and now I was using it to ride out of our solar system
and live the last short years of my life fully realising its potential.

"I should have known," he said, smiling crookedly, "that nothing is ever
so neat and tidy in this life."

"So you started taking the treatments again," Jean supplied. "But what
made you do it?"

"Oh, I apologise," he said. "That was indeed your question, and I didn't
quite answer it. I am so used to giving speeches to cameras, I sometimes
forget how to speak to a real person. Well, the reason I started the
treatments again was that I met Angharad. She is so beautiful, and so
complex in a way no one had expected. I would like to get to know her,
and I believe that it will take some time to do it." He lowered his
voice conspiratorially. "I believe we should all get to know her, Jean,
notwithstanding what some of these other people seem to want."

She was surprised, and after a moment, said, "Of course.

I still find it amazing that one type of life, from the millions that
developed from single cells, figured out that they can use bits of
matter to carry them long distances to see the universe from a different
perspective than they had in the beginning. It might have something to
do with experiencing the universe. We are encouraged to do so.
