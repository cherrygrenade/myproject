At the intersection of two overgrown roads, a small, squat pub sat under the rain.  Its stone walls were covered in ivy and moss and the wandering eye, believing it was another hillock, could easily lose it in the rough surrounding landscape.  Water dripped from its thatch and formed puddles in the cold mud of its trampled forecourt, collecting near the pile of sodden rushes at its open doors.  The scent of livestock and woodsmoke, weighed down by the rain, hung heavily in the air.  A well-weathered carved wooden sign fastened over its door proclaimed it to be The Old Mare.

Close enough to the open door to be legible in the pale and watery afternoon light was an unfurled map on a trestle table held down by two empty and misshapen clay cups that had formerly held beer.  Another full cup was held by a young man in well-worn clothing, bent over the map, tracing the roads with a charcoal-tinted finger.  Behind him was an older man in chainmail and leather armour, his arms crossed and a grim expression on his face.

“Solinole, or Wending Cross,” the young man was saying.  His blond hair was pulled back into a short tail, and streaks of grey - likely charcoal or perhaps dirt - marred his thin cheeks. His gentian coloured eyes, bright contrasted to the purple shadows underneath, were fixed on the map. “Both easily accessible on the north road, and not far from here.”

“You won’t be doing that, my lad,” said a voice from the dark interior of the pub.  The landlord straightened from stirring the fire, which was hotter than it needed to be for the slightly chill early autumn weather. He took a stained cloth that was tucked into his belt and began to rub the ash from his hands as he spoke. “Everything north of here is in a right state, not fit for travel, not at all.  Why, my cousin was just here the other week, travelling in from Ard’s Crip, and he said it’s all gone.  You won’t be finding a hospitable warm hearth there, no.”  

The young man laughed. “Oh, we’re not going for the hearths!  We’re going for the beasts.”  He turned back to the map and took a long pull from the beer.  “I reckon they are thick about this area, here.  Right north east of Solinole.”  He placed a fingertip on the map, between two of the painted hills.  The armoured man behind him shifted his weight to the other foot.

The landlord looked at both of them and slowly tucked the cloth back into his belt.  The armoured man returned his gaze impassively.  “The beasts, eh?” he said eventually.  “You’re going…for the beasts?”

“Oh yes,” the blond man said, looking up.  His blue eyes were intense in the pale light.  The rain strengthened, pattering on the mud outside, and a breeze lifted one of the unsecured corners of the map.  He put his now empty cup on that corner.  “We’ve already seen a few, of course, but we had to go looking for them.”  Behind him, the armoured man raised his eyes to the low wooden ceiling of the pub, but remained silent. “We need the ones that are coming down from the mountains.”

The landlord nodded without mirth.  “If beasts you want, beasts you will find,” he said.  “Another beer, sir?”

The young man grimaced.  “Haven’t you anything other than small beer?  Wine?  Brandy?”

“Wine?” scoffed the landlord.  “We haven’t had a shipment of wine for over a year.  The caravans won’t come through here, oh no, young sir, because of the…beasts.”  He almost spat the word, and put his hands on his hips.  “I sent my family away a while ago, down south. Since then, all the travel we’ve had through here has been people leaving the area.  Better custom than we’ve had in years, to tell you the truth, but short-lived.   The people around here are gone now, and you should be too.  Illy!” he shouted suddenly.  “Illy, get this man another beer.”  He disappeared into the back of the pub.

The young man returned to the map.  “Yes - see, Captain?  This is where they would come down.  It's faint, but it's called Mona Pass.  We know they’re coming in from the north east and there’s no easier way to travel down these slopes but there - it’s obvious, isn’t it?”  After a few meditative moments, he said, “I can feel you looking at me, you know.”

The armoured man hesitated, then sighed.  “I was only made captain for a season, as I have told you, Mage.”

“Captain is so much better than Sergeant-at-arms, I feel,” said the mage, not looking up.  “Less fuss in saying it.  Since you have such a problem with it, I will appoint you my Captain.  You are now Captain Merrick.  I will write to the head of the University to confirm, tonight.”

Merrick raised his eyebrows.  “A letter, from here?”

The mage shrugged.  “I’ll give it to the landlord, someone will pick it up, it will eventually find its way to the Archmage himself; there is no hurry.  It’s only important that I write the letter, not that they know about it.  As soon as I sign it, you’re officially my Captain, and I’ll hear no more about it.  Here, this is where we will go.  This village…it’s almost too small to see properly.  Let’s see, I think it says Fendhill.”

A gasp made both of the men turn to look into the shadowed pub.  A young girl stood there, clay cup of small beer in hand, mouth open.  After a frozen moment, she dropped her eyes and her mouth settled into a thin, unhappy line.  She approached the table and placed the cup on it.  She bobbed a curtsey and turned to go, eyes still down.

“Illy, isn’t it?” said the blond man, not ungently.  “What do you know about Fendhill?”

The girl stopped and slowly turned around again, not looking up from the ground.  Her hands picked themselves up from her sides and twisted themselves in her apron.  Her gaze remained lowered, and Merrick took the time to notice her homespun kirtle, the dirty apron, and her badly worn leather boots.  Her nails were broken, and her hem was worn.  Her hair, however, was in a neat chestnut braid around her head.  She was very young.  “Fendhill - sir?  Fendhill?”

The mage looked at her for an instant, and then looked back at the map.  “Yes.  Fendhill.  Just slightly north of Solinole.  Tiny place.  Do you know of it?”

The girl closed her eyes. “It is gone, sir.”

The young man tipped his head, and looked at her with his brilliant eyes.  Merrick started to say, hesitantly, “Mage Jensen,” but the mage waved a hand at him.

The young mage turned and started clearing the bench beside the trestle table of the various bags and books that had been stored there.  He handed these to Merrick who piled them tidily out of the way in a dark corner.  The girl didn’t move, didn’t watch them.  She stood as if she was in a trace.

When the bench was clear, Jensen went to the girl and took her arm. She didn’t resist when he sat her on the bench.  The mage sat next to her, close enough that his worn tunic overlapped with her stained apron.  He put an arm around her and held her tightly for a minute.  A mild gust of wind pushed in from the door, and Illy shivered, but otherwise didn’t react to anything.

“What was it?” said Jensen, softly.  “Was it ghilommes?”

The fire cracked in the hearth, and a log fell.  “It was fertzag,” said the girl at last, her voice lifting and breaking on the last word.  She raised a hand to her eyes.  “Only fertzag.”

Jensen watched her intently, his face close to hers and arm steady around her.  “How many fertzag?”

She returned her hand to her lap, where it sat open and lax.  Merrick could see the gems of tears on her fingers. “A lot.  At least…thirty.  Maybe more.”  Another tear fell on her dirty apron, unheeded.

“Thirty fertzag, all together,” marvelled Merrick. “Most people only see one or two in their lives.”  Jensen didn’t appear to hear him.

“How long ago was this, little charm?” he said instead.

“Six weeks,” whispered Illy.  She wiped the tears off her hand and twisted it back into her apron.  Her knuckles were white.

Jensen looked around the dark room, the two trestle tables, the low fire, the shuttered windows.  “And you’ve been here since.”  

Illy nodded silently, and put a hand to her face again.  After a moment, Merrick dug out his clean handkerchief and held it out to Jensen, who found Illy’s other hand and folded her fingers around the bit of fabric.  

For a few minutes the sound of the rain filled the room, and it breathed with the fresh scent of the water.  Eventually Jensen stirred.  “Do you know the way to Fendhill?” he asked, quietly.

The girl nodded, and sat up straighter. “Yes, I know the way from here.  But - you shouldn’t go.  It is so dangerous.”  She turned to look up at Jensen, blindly.  “There’s not only the fertzag, but there are strovels!  I think-” she said, and then looked down at her knees.  “I think that’s what…what happened to most of the people in Fendhill. And Solinole.  At least…that’s what I saw.”

The last was delivered in a mumble, and she fell silent again.  Jensen kept an arm around her, and chuckled lightly.  “You don’t know this, my charm, but I am able to deal with strovels, and fertzag, and anything else.  And my friend here,” he said, indicating Merrick, “can deal with any that I’ve missed.  We can go back and clean out that area of any remaining beasts and make sure that all who lived there have the rights spoken for them, to show the Goddess that they belong to her.”

“That would take some time,” observed Merrick, eyebrows drawing together.

“It will take some time but it’s the right thing to do,” said Jensen soothingly.  “Would you like that?” he asked Illy, who stared at her hands.

"Illy!" shouted the landlord from the back of the pub, and she shot up guitily.  "The cows!" she cried, and then dropped the handkerchief on the mage's lap before running hastily out of the room.

Mage Jensen picked it up, laughed, and stuck it in his pocket.  He stood up again, and began perusing the map.  Merrick didn't change his position, but shifted his weight again and returned his gaze to what was visible of the courtyard.

"So many fertzag, that doesn't seem right," said the mage, eventually.  He was examining the area of the map north of Mona Pass, which was mostly empty.  "What do you think of it, Captain?"

Merrick considered correcting him again and then grimaced, slightly.  "A strange thing, Mage.  It is hard to believe that so many could gather at once.  Perhaps the maid was overwhelmed with terror and overestimated their numbers.  It is an easy thing to do, in such circumstances."

The young man shook his head in wry agreement.  Merrick watched as he went to their piled belongings, rummaged through them, and emerged with a wooden box.  From the box Jensen took a long thin ceramic pipe, then searched through his pockets to produce a small waxed packet of seeds.  He put a pinch of the seeds into the bowl of the pipe and went to kneel in front of the fire to light it.

What happened next seemed very strange to Merrick.  His attention was on the young man, trying to light a splinter of wood for his pipe, the firelight illuminating the streaks of charcoal on his face.  Then Merrick noticed a change in the wan daylight coming in from the courtyard, and when he looked towards the door, there was a woman sitting at their table, hood up against the chill from the air.

Merrick was familiar enough with magic to know that something of the sort had happened, but he had not seen anything like it before.  His hand was on his sword, and he kept it there.

The woman made no move.  She was also young, about the same age as Jensen.  She had green eyes, a clear complexion, dark hair, and a watchful expression.  Her cloak was thick and fine, dyed in a deep green, and she had a cup of the same small beer that Jensen had been drinking in front of her.  Her hands were clasped together in her lap, and she was looking at Jensen.

Merrick was torn between his distrust of magic, his distrust of strangers, his courtly manners of dealing with young women, and his inclination to treat mages with cautious respect.  After a frozen moment, hand still tensely fixed on his sword, he said, "Good afternoon, my lady."  

She flicked her gaze at him.  "And to you, good sir."

Jensen finished lighting his pipe before coming to his feet in an athletic, smooth motion.  He took a small puff at it, and tossed the lit spill back into the fire.  He nodded at the woman and exhaled a cloud of smoke.  "Hello to you, lady.  Where have you come from?  I was assured that there was no one in the surrounding area, and I have not heard your horse or your mount."

"I arrived yesterday," said the woman.  Her voice, neutral and precise, gave nothing away.  "I have been scouting the area, and returned just a little while ago."  Merrick, watching her sharply, saw that she moved her right hand to clasp her left wrist.  He tensed at this, and looked to her face for any cues as to what she would do next, but her eyes remained steadily on Mage Jensen.

"Oh, I see," said the mage.  "Well met.  But have you come with a caravan?  The landlord has said no caravans have ventured into the area, for months."  He puffed at his pipe again, the cherry red coal in the bowl brightening, and smiled as he breathed out.

The woman's gaze wandered to the courtyard, where the rain was falling in silver patterns with the wind.  Merrick noted that her cloak was dry.  "He's right, there have been no caravans for months," she said, dispassionately.  "It would be far easier to travel with one, especially over the mountain passes."

"You're going north?" Mage Jensen said, raising his eyebrows. 

Her eyes were steady.  "I must go north," she said, simply. 

A gust of wind blew a spray of rain in through the door.  The map rattled, and Jensen moved to roll it up, dislodging empty cups and a stick of charcoal.  "You must go north?" he repeated, chuckling.  She watched him as he tied an outer layer of waxed canvas around the map and stored it with the rest of their things.  "You're going to wait a while for a caravan, then.  We're going north ourselves, tomorrow, and we hear it's very dangerous.  You might be better off seeking a different way."  He glanced at her briefly, his bright eyes curious.  "What is so important that you are going north at this time of year? We're very near the first frost.  If you're headed for Altry, wait for spring."

"I have no business in Altry," said the woman.  "I am headed for Mona Pass, and the wild lands between. If you are going north, perhaps we can travel together for some distance."

The young man widened his eyes.  "You are headed for the wild lands?" he said, and then he started hunting through their belongings again.

Merrick watched this with rising alarm, and after a moment, mentally sighed. He cleared his throat and removed his hand from his sword.  "My lady, we are exploring this part of Morn, following tales of crazed beasts.  We may travel as far as Mona Pass but may not go further north. We are to return to Cavendil within the week."

"We can extend for a few days," said Jensen.  

Every child in Morn heard tales from their mother about the wild lands.  Every fantastical story included an element from those lands, such as 
















“Thom, the landlord here.  He says that we’re going to flee too, just a couple of days from now.”  She knuckled her red eyes again, and rubbed them with the handkerchief.  Beneath this, she tried to smile.  “He said he would make sure my bed was warm on the way.  So kind of him.  It has been so cold lately.” 

Jensen and Merrick froze.  Then the fire cracked again, and Jensen could calmly move his arm from her waist upward so he could grip her shoulder.  “How old are you, my charm?”

“I…turned thirteen just a couple of weeks before…before I had to come here.”  She didn’t challenge the question, but looked at the crumpled handkerchief in dismay.

“You've done very well for being thirteen,” said Mage Jensen, and Merrick thought that wasn't the half of it. One lone child, against so many fertzag, and however many struvels there had been…the odds were incredible.
